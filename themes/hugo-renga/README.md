# Renga

[Live Preview](https://nanx.me/hugo-renga/)

[Renga](https://github.com/nanxstats/hugo-renga) is a Bootstrap-based minimalist theme for Hugo.

The Renga theme offers a balance between minimalism and flexibility. Users can publish new content quickly with simple Markdown, or construct complex pages by writing HTML with Bootstrap 4, thus suitable for building personal websites that feature both porfolio pages and blog.

Renga is inspired and based on the Hugo themes [alaGeek](https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-alageek-theme/) and [Cocoa](https://themes.gohugo.io/cocoa/).
