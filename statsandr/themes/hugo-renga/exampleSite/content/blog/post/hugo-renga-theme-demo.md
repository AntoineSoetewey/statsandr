Some text, and some `code` and then a nice plain [link with title](https://nanx.me "title text!").

and then

+ Create a list by starting a line with `+`, `-`, or `*`
+ Sub-lists are made by indenting 2 spaces:
  - Marker character change forces new list start:
    * Ac tristique libero volutpat at
+ Very easy!

vs.

1. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet
2. Consectetur adipiscing elit
