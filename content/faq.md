## 2. Why did you launch this blog?

See why I launched this blog in my article about the [main benefits of having a technical blog](/blog/7-benefits-of-sharing-your-code-in-a-data-science-blog/).

<a name="technology"></a>
## 3. What technology and theme do you use to write this blog and the articles?

This blog is written in R using the [`{blogdown}` package](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) and Hugo, and deployed and hosted via Netlify.

Regarding the theme, I wanted to focus on the information I provide in my articles and did not want to distract readers with too many features, so I chose the [Renga](https://github.com/nanxstats/hugo-renga) theme, which is a minimalist theme for Hugo/blogdown. As the blog evolved, I made minor changes to the code that I considered important.

The code of this website can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/AntoineSoetewey/statsandr).

## 11. Can you link to my website?

Thank you for your interest.

With the exception of a few rare cases, I will not add your link to one of my article for two simple reasons:

1. There are plenty of great resources online (yours included). This means that if I accept your request, I will have to accept requests from everyone else
1. I link to content that I think will help my readers learn something about statistics or R *at the time I write each article*

If you believe you have a relevant contribution to an article, feel free to post it in the comments of that article. It is an excellent way to contribute to the ongoing discussion and readers will be able to check your work.
