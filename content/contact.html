<p>Thanks in advance for contacting me.</p>

<p>In order for me to answer you as soon as possible, here are the best communication methods:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Due to the increasing number of questions received, responding to each of them by email has become unmanageable and unproductive. Therefore, if you have a <b>question</b> in statistics or R, I invite you to <b>add it as a comment</b> at the end of the corresponding article. This way, other readers can benefit from the discussion and that saves me from answering the same thing several times. Questions by email will *not* be answered (I will redirect you to the comments).</li>
  <li>For mistakes, bugs or inconsistencies—and that can happen, we are all human after all—you can inform me about them by <a href="https://github.com/AntoineSoetewey/statsandr/issues" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raising an issue</a> on GitHub. If you are familiar with GitHub, you can even edit the corresponding file and propose a pull request so I can quickly include your changes.</li>
  <li>For all other requests, please use the contact form below</li>
  <ul><li>If you need to send a file, first fill in the contact form to which I will reply and from there you will be able to send me your file (this is to limit spam)</li></ul>
</ul>

<p>For a quick answer to your question, make sure to first check the <a href="/faq/">FAQ</a> and comments from other readers. Your question may have already been answered.</p>
