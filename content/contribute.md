## How can you contribute?

If you want to contribute and write for [www.statsandr.com](/), please submit your article through this <a href="https://antoine233987.typeform.com/to/nlWzhn" target="_blank" rel="noopener">contribution form</a>.

## Submission rules and guidelines

Before submitting your article, please bear in mind the following points:

* At the moment I only accept articles that have already been published somewhere else on internet.
* To avoid one of us being penalized by Google for duplicate content, please mention the link to your article in the <a href="https://antoine233987.typeform.com/to/nlWzhn" target="_blank" rel="noopener">contribution form</a> so I can add the `rel=canonical` element.
* I personally read and check the content and formatting of your article to guarantee its correctness and so that it fits into this blog. I may edit the article with minor corrections, without changing the content. I might also remove images where the source is not clearly cited to avoid copyright violations.
* It is your responsibility to ensure you have the permission to use all content, images, and videos you include in your articles.
* You can edit and remove your article from the blog at any time, without justification needed.
* This blog is written in R and deployed thanks to the `{blogdown}` package. Therefore, it is much easier for me to publish articles written in R Markdown (.Rmd) or Markdown (.md). However, if your article is in another format, feel free to submit it as well.
* If you are having an issue with the online form, you can send a link to your article via the [contact page](/contact/). (But please do not send your article via this page if you already submitted it via the contribution form.)
* All articles that are accepted on the blog will be published on <a href="https://medium.com/@ant.soetewey" target="_blank" rel="noopener">www.medium.com</a> and on the <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/@ant.soetewey" target="_blank" rel="noopener">www.towardsdatascience.com</a> publication. Moreover, it will also be published on <a href="https://rweekly.org/live" target="_blank" rel="noopener">www.rweekly.org</a> and, if it is related to R, to <a href="https://www.r-bloggers.com/author/r-on-stats-and-r/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">www.r-bloggers.com</a>.
* A link to the original post will be added at the end of the article.
