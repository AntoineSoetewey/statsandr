<p>I am happy to announce that our paper entitled “<a href="https://rdcu.be/cKLGO">Semi-Markov modeling for cancer insurance</a>” has been accepted for publication in the European Actuarial Journal <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-soetewey2022semi" role="doc-biblioref">Soetewey et al. 2022</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Advancements in medicine and biostatistics have already resulted in a better access to insurance for people diagnosed with cancer. This materializes into the “right to be forgotten” adopted in several EU member states, granting access to insurance after a waiting period of at most 10 years starting at the end of the successful therapeutic protocol.</p>
<p>This paper concentrates on insurance covers on a market where such a right has been implemented. Stand-alone products are considered, as well as guarantees included as a rider in an existing package. The cost of offering standard premium rates to all applicants in mortgage insurance related to property loans is also evaluated.</p>
<p>The 3-state (healthy—ill—dead) Semi-Markov hierarchical model developed in Denuit et al. (2019) for long-term care insurance is adopted here for actuarial calculations. Semi-Markov transition intensities are estimated from cancer cases recorded by the Belgian Cancer Registry. The obtained results suggest that a new offer could develop, targeting the particular needs of cancer patients.</p>

<p>Note that this paper is written jointly with Prof. Legrand and Prof. Denuit—my PhD supervisors at UCLouvain—and Dr. Silversmit from the Belgian Cancer Registry.</p>
