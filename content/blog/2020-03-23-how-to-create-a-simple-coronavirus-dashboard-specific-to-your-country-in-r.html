<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>The Novel COVID-19 Coronavirus is the hottest topic right now. Every day, the media and newspapers share the number of new cases and deaths in several countries, try to measure the impacts of the virus on citizens and remind us to stay home in order to stay safe. The Coronavirus is on everyone’s lips.</p>
<p>In addition to governments, media and companies discussing about it, data scientists and data professionals in general are putting their knowledge and time at the service of the virus. This leads to a proliferation of applications, dashboards, blog posts, videos, datasets and code analyzing, in one way or another, the expension of the COVID-19 and how it spreads in the population.</p>

<h1>Top R resources on Coronavirus</h1>
<p>As a data lover myself, I discovered a multitude of great resources about the Coronavirus. However, these resources were spread all over the internet and were often hidden by the mass of information of another type (e.g., alarming headlines, names of infected celebrities, companies showing off how they helped health care agencies, etc.). To tackle this issue, I collected and then shared in an article <a href="/blog/https://www.statsandr.com/blog/top-r-resources-on-covid-19-coronavirus/">the best R resources on the Coronavirus</a> I came across.</p>
<p>Note that only resources on R are shared in this article as R is my favorite statistical program and the one I am most familiar with. The fact that I use this program almost daily makes it easier for me to realize the complexity and time put behind a resource, and appreciate its quality and its potential. I am sure that there are other very interesting resources online (see for example the probably <a href="https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html" target="_blank">most popular dashboard</a> by the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center).<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Nonetheless, a lot of people are in a better position than I am to judge the quality of resources made with programming languages for which I am not competent.</p>
<p>This <a href="/blog/top-r-resources-on-covid-19-coronavirus/">article</a> made me discover so many great resources about the Coronavirus and I keep receiving data visualizations and data analyses from scientists all over the world so that I include them in the collection. Thanks for that, it continuously improves the quality and completeness of the collection.</p>

<h1>How to create a dashboard specific to your country</h1>
<p>In addition to R resources, a question often asked by readers was “How can I create a dashboard myself?” or “How can I build a dashboard specific to my country?”. I therefore thought it would serve some people if I created a dashboard specific to my country (Belgium) and detailed the steps on how to build it.</p>
<p>Questions on how to develop such dashboards came mostly from R beginners as advanced R users most probably know how to do one, or at least can easily use these resources as inspirations for their own work. This led me to create a simple (yet powerful and visually appealing) dashboard. Furthermore, in response to the craze about the Coronavirus, interested users were quite in a hurry. For the sake of easiness, I thus decided to adapt an already existing <a href="https://ramikrispin.github.io/coronavirus_dashboard/" target="_blank">dashboard</a> (with a license that allows to be freely adapted and shared) instead of building one from scratch.</p>
<p>Before reading further, here is the <a href="https://www.antoinesoetewey.com/files/coronavirus-dashboard.html" target="_blank">link to the dashboard</a> in question and a preview of it below:</p>

<p>If you want to build your own dashboard specific to a country, follow these steps:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Click on the button “Source code” located in the top right corner. Copy that code.</li>
<li>Open a new R Markdown file (<code>.Rmd</code>), choose a title, select HTML as output format and click on OK:</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="/blog/2020-03-23-how-to-create-a-simple-coronavirus-dashboard-specific-to-your-country-in-r_files/Screenshot%202020-03-23%20at%2015.38.45.png" style="width:100.0%" /></p>
<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Remove all the template code already present and paste the code you copied in step 1.</li>
<li>Make sure to install the required packages:</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>install.packages(&quot;devtools&quot;)
devtools::install_github(&quot;RamiKrispin/coronavirus&quot;)</code></pre>
<ol start="5" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Knit the document. If you followed these steps correctly, your dashboard should appear in HTML format.</li>
<li>In the code, replace <code>Belgium</code> with your country.</li>
</ol>
<p>Following these 6 basic steps, you should already have a simple dashboard specific to your country. I have intentionnally kept it simple so that everyone could copy it and have their own dashboard in a limited amount of time. If you are familiar with the <code>{flexdashboard}(https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/flexdashboard/){target=&quot;_blank&quot;}</code>, <code>{plotly}(https://plot.ly/r/){target=&quot;_blank&quot;}</code> and <code>{leaflet}(https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/){target=&quot;_blank&quot;}</code> packages for the dashboard interface and the visualizations, and the <code>{dplyr}(https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/){target=&quot;_blank&quot;}</code> and <code>{tidyr}(https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/){target=&quot;_blank&quot;}</code> packages for the data manipulation, feel free to edit the code according to your needs.</p>
