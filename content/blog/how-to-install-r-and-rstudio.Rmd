# What is R and RStudio?

## R

**R** is nothing more than a programming language. At the time of writing, this language is (one of) the leading program in statistics, although not the only programming language used by statisticians.

In order to use R, we need two things:

* a text editor in which to write our code
* a place to run this code

You can download R at <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html" target="_blank">https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html</a>. Select the CRAN mirror site closest to you, then in the box labeled "Download and Install R", click the link corresponding to your operating system.

## RStudio

This is where RStudio comes handy. RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) for R. This software has the advantage of offering both a powerful text editor for writing your code and a place to run the code written in this editor (and I would add that it is more user-friendly). For these reasons, I highly recommend using RStudio instead of R. (Note that RStudio requires the prior installation of the R software provided by CRAN in order to be able to function properly. Just installing RStudio on your personal computer is not enough.)

You can download RStudio at <a href="https://www.rstudio.com" target="_blank">www.rstudio.com</a>.

# The main components of RStudio

Now that both programs are installed on your computer, let's dive into the main components of RStudio.

By default, the RStudio window has three panes:

1. The console (red pane),
1. The environment (green pane),
1. Files, plots, help, etc. (blue pane).

The console (red pane) is where you can execute your code (more information on the red and blue panes later). By default, the text editor does not open automatically. To open it, click on File > New File > R Script or click on the button representing a white sheet marked with a small green cross in the upper left corner, then on R Script:

A new pane (in orange below), also known as the text editor, opens in which you will be able to write your code. The code will be executed and the results displayed in the console (red pane).

Note that you can also write code in the console (red pane). However, I strongly recommend writing your code in the text editor (orange pane) because you can save the code written in the text editor (and thus execute it again later), while you cannot save the code written in the console.

To execute code written in the text editor (orange pane), you have two options:

* Type your code and then press the "Run" button (see below) or use the keyboard shortcut CTRL + Enter (cmd + Enter on Mac). **Only the line** of code where your cursor is located will then be executed.
* Type your code and select in the text editor the part you want to execute and then press the "Run" button or use the keyboard shortcut CTRL + Enter (cmd + Enter on Mac). All the **selected** code will be executed.

For example, try typing `1+1` in the text editor and execute it by clicking on "Run" (or CTRL/cmd + Enter). You should see the result `2` in the console, as the screenshot below:

![Example of code executed in RStudio](/blog/how-to-install-r-and-rstudio_files/example of code executed in RStudio.png)

The text editor and the console are the panes you will use most ofen. The two other panes (the blue and green panes introduced earlier) will however still be very useful when using RStudio.

The environment (green pane) displays all values stored by RStudio. For example, if you type and execute the code `a = 1`, RStudio will store the value `1` for `a`, as the screenshot below:

![Environment pane in RStudio](/blog/how-to-install-r-and-rstudio_files/environment pane in RStudio2.png)

This means that you can now perform any computations with `a`, such that if you execute `a + 1`, RStudio will render `2` in the console. In this pane you can also see a tab with a history of the code executed and a button to import a dataset (more on [importing a dataset in RStudio here](/blog/how-to-import-an-excel-file-in-rstudio/)).

The last pane (blue) is where you will find everything else such as your files, the plots, the packages, the help documentation, etc. I discuss about the Files tab in more details [here](/blog/how-to-import-an-excel-file-in-rstudio/) so let's discuss about the other tabs:

* Plot: where you will see the rendered plots. For instance, run `plot(1:10)` and you should see it in this tab,
* Packages: where you see all your installed packages. Remind that RStudio is open source; everyone can write code and publish it as a package. You are then able to use this package (and all functions built inside this package) for free. Some packages are installed by default, others can be easily installed by running `install.packages("name of the package")` (do not forget `""` around the name of the package!). Once the package is installed, you must load the package and only after it has been loaded you can use all the functions it contains. To load a package, run `library(name of the package)` (this time `""` around the name of the package are not needed, but can still be used if you wish). Note that you will need to install packages **only once**, but load packages **each time** you open RStudio,
* Help: documentation about all functions written for R. To access the help of a function, run `help(name of the function)` or simply `?name of the function`. For example, to see the help about the mean function, run `?mean`.

# Further applications

Now that you have installed R and RStudio and you know its main components, below are some examples of basic code. More advanced code and analyses are presented in [other articles about R](/tags/R/).
