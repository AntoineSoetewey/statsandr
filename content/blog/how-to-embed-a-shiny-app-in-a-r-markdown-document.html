<div id="step-by-step-guide" class="section level1">
<h1>Step-by-step guide</h1>
<p>If you have developed and deployed a Shiny app and would like to embed it in blogdown, follow these steps:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>create a new post as usual</li>
<li>add <code>output: html_document</code> if it is not already included in the YAML metadata</li>
<li>insert the following HTML code in the body of the post:</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>&lt;iframe height=&quot;800&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; frameborder=&quot;no&quot; src=&quot;https://antoinesoetewey.shinyapps.io/statistics-201/&quot;&gt; &lt;/iframe&gt;</code></pre>
<p>You should change the URL with the URL of your deployed Shiny app (after <code>src=</code>, do not forget that the URL should start with <code>http://</code> or <code>https://</code> and should be surrounded by <code>"</code>). Moreover, you can modify the height, the width and include or not a frame border with the corresponding tags.</p>
<p>Here is an example of the result with one of my Shiny app (<a href="https://antoinesoetewey.shinyapps.io/statistics-201/" target="_blank">link</a> to the app):</p>
<iframe height="800" width="100%" frameborder="no" src="https://antoinesoetewey.shinyapps.io/statistics-201/">
</iframe>
<p><br></p>
<p><em>Note that the app may not work if it has hit the monthly usage limit. Try again later if that is the case.</em></p>
</div>
<div id="code" class="section level1">
<h1>Code</h1>
<p>Here is the entire <code>.Rmd</code> code in case you would like to use it for your own website:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/AntoineSoetewey/d8c357439e6e23341ed4321d910d9181.js"></script>
<p>If you encounter an issue, try loading the following packages in the body of your new post: <code>shiny</code>, <code>widgetframe</code> (you can load a package with the command <code>library(widgetframe)</code>). If one of the package is not installed yet, you can do it with the command <code>install.packages("widgetframe")</code>.</p>
