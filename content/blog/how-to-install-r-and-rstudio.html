<h1>What is R and RStudio?</h1>
<p><strong>R</strong> is nothing more than a programming language. At the time of writing, this language is (one of) the leading program in statistics, although not the only programming language used by statisticians.</p>
<p>In order to use R, we need two things:</p>
<ul>
<li>a text editor in which to write our code</li>
<li>a place to run this code</li>
</ul>
<p>You can download R at <a href="https://www.freestatistics.org/cran/" target="_blank">www.freestatistics.org/cran/</a>.</p>
<p>This is where RStudio comes handy. RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) for R. This software has the advantage of offering both a powerful text editor for writing your code and a place to run the code written in this editor (and I would add that it is more user-friendly). For these reasons, I highly recommend using RStudio instead of R. (Note that RStudio requires the prior installation of the R software provided by CRAN in order to be able to function properly. Just installing RStudio on your personal computer is not enough.)</p>
<p>You can download RStudio at <a href="https://www.rstudio.com" target="_blank">www.rstudio.com</a>.</p>
