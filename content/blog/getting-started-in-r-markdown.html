<p>If you have spent some time writing code in R, you probably have heard of generating dynamic reports incorporating R code, R outputs and text. In this article, I will explain how it works and give you the basic elements you need to get started easily in the production of these dynamic reports.</p>
<div id="r-markdown-what-and-why" class="section level1">
<h1>R Markdown: what and why?</h1>
<p>R Markdown allows to generate a dynamic report that is automatically generated from a file written within RStudio. The first main advantage of using R Markdown over R is that, in a R Markdown document, you can combine three important parts of any statistical analysis:</p>
<ul>
<li>R code to show how the analyses have been done. For instance, the data and the functions you used. This allows readers to follow your code and to check that the analyses were correctly peformed.</li>
<li>Results of the code, that is, the output of your analyses. For example, the output of your linear model, the plots, or the results of the test you just coded. This allows readers to see the results of your analyses.</li>
<li>Text, comments and interpretations of the results. For instance, after computing the main descriptive statistics and plotting some graphs, you can interpret them in the context of the analyses, or highlight important findings. This allows readers to understand your results thanks to your interpretations and your comments.</li>
</ul>
