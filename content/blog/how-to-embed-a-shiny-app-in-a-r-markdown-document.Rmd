# Introduction

If you have developed a Shiny app and would like to embed it in blogdown, follow these steps:

1. create a new post as usual
1. add `runtime: shiny` (and `output: html_document` if it is not already included) in the YAML metadata
1. load the following packages in the body of your new post: `shiny`, `widgetframe` (you can load a package with the command `library(widgetframe)`. If the package is not installed yet, you can do it with the command `install.packages("widgetframe")`)
1. insert the following HTML code in the body of the post:

```
# change URL with the URL of your deployed Shiny app
<iframe height="800" width="100%" frameborder="no" src="https://antoinesoetewey.shinyapps.io/statistics-201/"> </iframe>
```

Here is an example of the result with one of my Shiny app:

<!-- # ```{r setup, include=FALSE} -->
<!-- # knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE) -->
<!-- #  -->
<!-- # library(dplyr) -->
<!-- # library(ggplot2) -->
<!-- # library(reshape2) -->
<!-- # library(shiny) -->
<!-- # library(widgetframe) -->
<!-- # library(knitr) -->
<!-- # ``` -->
