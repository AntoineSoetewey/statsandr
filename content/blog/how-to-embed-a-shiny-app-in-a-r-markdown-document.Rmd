# Introduction

If you have developed a Shiny app and would like to embed it in blogdown, follow these steps:

1. create a new post as usual
1. add `runtime: shiny` (and `output: html_document` if it is not already included) in the YAML metadata
1. install the package "widgetframe" (`install.packages("widgetframe")`)
1. load the package in the body of your new post (`library(widgetframe)`)
1. insert the following code in the body of the post:

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
# change URL with your URL
<iframe height="800" width="100%" frameborder="no" src="https://antoinesoetewey.shinyapps.io/statistics-201/"> </iframe>
```

Here is an example of the result with one of my Shiny app:

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(reshape2)
library(shiny)
library(widgetframe)
library(knitr)
```
