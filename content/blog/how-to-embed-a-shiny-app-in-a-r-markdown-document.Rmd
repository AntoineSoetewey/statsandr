If you have developed and deployed a Shiny app and would like to embed it in blogdown, follow these steps:

1. create a new post as usual
1. add `runtime: shiny` (and `output: html_document` if it is not already included) in the YAML metadata
1. insert the following HTML code in the body of the post:

```
# change URL with the URL of your deployed Shiny app
<iframe height="800" width="100%" frameborder="no" src="https://antoinesoetewey.shinyapps.io/statistics-201/"> </iframe>
```

You should change the URL with the URL of your deployed Shiny app (after `src=`, do not forget that the URL should start with `http://` or `https://` and should be surrounded by `"`. Moreover, you can modify the height, the width and include or not a frame border with the corresponding tags.

Here is an example of the result with one of my Shiny app:

<iframe height="800" width="100%" frameborder="no" src="https://antoinesoetewey.shinyapps.io/statistics-201/"> </iframe>

The code of this article can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/AntoineSoetewey/statsandr/blob/master/content/blog/how-to-embed-a-shiny-app-in-a-r-markdown-document.Rmd).

If you encounter an issue, try loading the following packages in the body of your new post: `shiny`, `widgetframe` (you can load a package with the command `library(widgetframe)`. If the package is not installed yet, you can do it with the command `install.packages("widgetframe")`.
