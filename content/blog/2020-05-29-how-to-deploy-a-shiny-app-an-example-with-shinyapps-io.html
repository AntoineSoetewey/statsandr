<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>A reader recently asked me how to publish a <a href="/tags/shiny/">Shiny app</a> she just created. Similarly to a previous article where I show <a href="/blog/how-to-upload-r-code-on-github-example-with-an-r-script-on-mac-os/">how to upload R code on GitHub</a>, I thought it would be useful to some people to see how I publish my Shiny apps.</p>
<p>Before going through the different steps to deploy your Shiny app online, you can check the final result with my Shiny apps <a href="/tags/shiny/">here</a>.</p>
<p><em>Note 1: The screenshots have been taken on MacOS and I have not tested it on Windows. Do not hesitate to let me know in the comments whether it is similar or not on other operating systems.</em></p>
<p><em>Note 2: There are other ways to publish your app (with Docker for example), but the method shown below is (in my opinion) easy and works well.</em></p>

<h1>Prerequisite</h1>
<p>I personally use the <a href="https://www.shinyapps.io/" target="_blank">shinyapps.io</a> platform to deploy my Shiny apps. So in order to follow this guide you will first need to create an account (if you do not already have one).</p>
<p>For this tutorial, we will illustrate the different steps with a very basic Shiny app. You can however always use this tutorial for more advanced apps.</p>
