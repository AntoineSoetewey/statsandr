# Introduction

*This is a joint work with Prof. [Niko Speybroeck](https://twitter.com/NikoSpeybroeck){target="_blank"} and [Angel Rosas-Aguirre](https://twitter.com/arosas_aguirre){target="_blank"}.*

Belgium recently started to lift its lockdown measures initially imposed to contain the spread of the Covid-19. Following this decision taken by Belgian authorities, we analyze how the situation evolved so far.

Contrarily to a previous article in which I analyzed the outbreak of the [Coronavirus in Belgium using the SIR model](/blog/covid-19-in-belgium/), in this article we focus on the evolution of:

* the number of hospital admissions (per 100,000 inhabitants)
* the number of new confirmed cases (also per 100,000 inhabitants)

at the province and national level.

Data is from [Sciensano](https://epistat.wiv-isp.be/covid/){target="_blank"}.

*Note that the reported number of new confirmed cases is probably underestimated, so this figure should be interpreted with extreme caution.*

Thanks for reading. We hope that these figures will keep evolving in the right direction. In the meantime, take care and stay safe!
