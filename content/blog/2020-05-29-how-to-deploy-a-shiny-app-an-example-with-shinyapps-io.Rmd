# Introduction

A reader recently asked me how to publish a [Shiny app](/tags/shiny/) she just created. Similarly to a previous article where I show [how to upload R code on GitHub](/blog/how-to-upload-r-code-on-github-example-with-an-r-script-on-mac-os/), I thought it would be useful to some people to see how I publish my Shiny apps.

Before going through the different steps to deploy your Shiny app online, you can check the final result with my apps [here](/tags/shiny/).

*Note 1: The screenshots have been taken on MacOS and I have not tested it on Windows. Do not hesitate to let me know in the comments whether it is similar or not on other operating systems.*

*Note 2: There are other ways to publish your app (with Docker for example), but the method shown below is (in my opinion) easy and works well.*

# Prerequisite

I personally use the [shinyapps.io](https://www.shinyapps.io/){target="_blank"} platform to deploy my [Shiny apps](/tags/shiny/). So in order to follow this guide you will first need to create an account (if you do not already have one).

They offer a free plan, but you are limited to 5 active applications and a monthly usage of 25 active hours. 

For your information, if you make your app available to a wide audience, expect to exceed the monthly cap of active hours quite quickly. To increase the monthly limit (or to publish more than 5 apps), you will need to upgrade your plan to a paying one. 

# Step-by-step guide

Step 1: Open RStudio and create a new Shiny app:

Step 2: Give it a name, choose where to save it and click on the Create button:

Step 3: The code for a basic app is created, run the app to see the result:

Step 4: The basic app opens, publish it:

Step 5: If it is your first Shiny app, the box "Publish From Account" should be empty. Click on "Add New Account" to link the shinyapps.io account you just created:

Step 6: Click on the first alternative (ShinyApps.io):

Step 7: Click on the link to your ShinyApps account:

Step 8: Click on the Dashboard button to log in into your account:

![](/blog/2020-05-29-how-to-deploy-a-shiny-app-an-example-with-shinyapps-io_files/publish-shiny-app-online-shinyapps-io-8.png){width=100%}

Step 9: Click on your name and then on Tokens

Step 10: If this is your first app, there should be no token already created. Create one by clicking on the Add Token button. Then Click on the Show button:

Step 11: Click on the Show Secret button:

Step 12: Now the code is complete (nothing is hidden). Click on the Copy to clipboard button:

![](/blog/2020-05-29-how-to-deploy-a-shiny-app-an-example-with-shinyapps-io_files/publish-shiny-app-online-shinyapps-io-12.png){width=100%}

Step 13: Copy the code and click on the OK button:

![](/blog/2020-05-29-how-to-deploy-a-shiny-app-an-example-with-shinyapps-io_files/publish-shiny-app-online-shinyapps-io-13.png){width=100%}

Step 14: Paste the code in the console of RStudio and run it. This will enable your computer to deploy applications to your shinyapps.io account:

Step 15: Go back to the window to publish your app, choose a title and click on the Publish button:

Step 16: After several seconds (depending on the weight of your app), the Shiny app should appear in your internet browser:

Step 17: You can now edit the app (or replace the entire code by another of your app), and run the app. For this illustration, I just added a link for more information in the side panel:

Step 18: Check that the modifications have been taken into account (the link appears in the side panel as expected) and republish your app:

Step 19: Click on the Publish button:

Step 20: Your app is live! You can now share it and everyone with the link will be able to use it:

# Additional notes

If you need to change the settings of your Shiny app, go to your dashboard and click on the app you just created to access the settings:
