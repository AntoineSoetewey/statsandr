# Introduction

A reader recently asked me how to publish a [Shiny app](/tags/shiny/) she just created. Similarly to a previous article where I show [how to upload R code on GitHub](/blog/how-to-upload-r-code-on-github-example-with-an-r-script-on-mac-os/), I thought it would be useful to some people to see how I publish my Shiny apps.

Before going through the different steps to deploy your Shiny app online, you can check the final result with my Shiny apps [here](/tags/shiny/).

*Note 1: The screenshots have been taken on MacOS and I have not tested it on Windows. Do not hesitate to let me know in the comments whether it is similar or not on other operating systems.*

*Note 2: There are other ways to publish your app (with Docker for example), but the method shown below is (in my opinion) easy and works well.*

# Prerequisite

I personally use the [shinyapps.io](https://www.shinyapps.io/){target="_blank"} platform to deploy my Shiny apps. So in order to follow this guide you will first need to create an account (if you do not already have one).

For this tutorial, we will illustrate the different steps with a very basic Shiny app. You can however always use this tutorial for more advanced apps.
