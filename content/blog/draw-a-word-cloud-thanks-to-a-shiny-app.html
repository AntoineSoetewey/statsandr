<p>Below a Shiny app to help you draw a word cloud:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://antoinesoetewey.shinyapps.io/word-cloud/">Word cloud</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Word clouds are particularily useful as part of text mining analyses. Moreover, it is also useful to analyze string and character variables for any datasets (see the <a href="/blog/data-types-in-r/">different data types in R</a>).</p>
<p><em>Note that the link may not work if the app has hit the monthly usage limit. Try again later if that is the case.</em></p>

<h1>How to use this app?</h1>
<ul>
<li>In <strong>Word source</strong> you can see two examples of word clouds with preloaded texts. If you want to use your own file, choose the option “Upload a file”</li>
<li>When uploading a file, make sure to upload a .csv or .txt file</li>
<li>If it is a .csv file, there should be only one column containing all words or sentences (see example files: <a href="https://www.antoinesoetewey.com/files/ihaveadream.csv">example.csv</a> and <a href="https://www.antoinesoetewey.com/files/ihaveadream.txt">example.txt</a>)</li>
<li>Choose the language of the text. Stop words in the chosen language will be automatically removed</li>
<li>Numbers and punctuations will be automatically removed as well, regardless of the language</li>
<li>You can remove specific words by specifying them after having clicked on “Remove specific words?”. Indicate one word per line</li>
<li>Change the default options in <strong>Maximum number of words</strong> and <strong>Background color</strong> if needed</li>
<li>If you need to display this word cloud in your analyses, you can simply take a screenshot and include it in your document</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope you will find this app useful to draw word clouds of your texts. If you want to learn more about Shiny apps in R, see all <a href="/tags/shiny/">articles related to Shiny</a>.</p>
