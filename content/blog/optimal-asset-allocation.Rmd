In his book *A Random Walk Down Wall Street*, Burton G. Malkiel advise readers of an optimal asset allocation depending on age. As an amateur investor, I thought it would be useful to develop a Shiny app which depicts his advices for other interested investors. Here is the app:

* [Optimal asset allocation](https://antoinesoetewey.shinyapps.io/optimal-asset-allocation/)

# How to use this app?

1. Open the app via this [link](https://antoinesoetewey.shinyapps.io/optimal-asset-allocation/)
1. Set your age under **How old are you?**
1. Indicate how much you are willing to invest

On the right panel (or below depending on the size of your screen) you will see a table and a barplot. The table includes:

* the different type of assets which represent the different allocations
* the most common tickers for each type of asset
* the optimal percentage for each asset
* the optimal amount for each asset

In the table, the optimal percentage depends on your age (the older you are, the more conservative your portfolio), while the optimal amount depends on the amount you are willing to invest.

The barplot displays the optimal weight (so optimal percentage of your portfolio) depending on the type of asset (stocks, bonds, real estate or cash).

I hope you will find this app useful to compute probabilities for the main distributions. If you want to learn more about Shiny apps in R, see all [articles related to Shiny](/tags/shiny/).
