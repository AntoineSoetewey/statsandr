The Coronavirus is a serious concern around the globe. With its expansion, there are also more and more online resources about it. This article presents a selection of the best R resources on the COVID-19 virus.

This list is by no means exhaustive. I am not aware of all R resources available online about the Coronavirus, so please feel free to let me know in the comments or by [contacting me](/contact/) if you believe that another resource (R package, Shiny app, R code, blog posts, datasets, etc.) deserves to be on this list.

## Analyzing COVID-19 outbreak data with R

![](/blog/top-r-resources-on-coronavirus_files/Analyzing COVID-19 outbreak data with R.png){width=100%}

Written by [Tim Churches](https://timchurches.github.io/){target="_blank"}, these two articles ([part 1](https://timchurches.github.io/blog/posts/2020-02-18-analysing-covid-19-2019-ncov-outbreak-data-with-r-part-1/){target="_blank"} and [part 2](https://timchurches.github.io/blog/posts/2020-03-01-analysing-covid-19-2019-ncov-outbreak-data-with-r-part-2/){target="_blank"}) explore the R tools and packages that might be used to analyze the COVID-19 data. In particular, the author considers when the pandemic will subside in China, and then turns the analysis on Japan, South Korea, Italy and Iran. He also shows improvements on the cumulative incidence plots that are so common. Moreover, he presents R code to analyze how contagious is the Coronavirus thanks to the classic SIR (Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered) compartmental model of communicable disease outbreaks.^[See more information about this epidemiological model in this [post](https://rpubs.com/choisy/sir){target="_blank"} by Marc Choisy.]

The code is available on GitHub ([part 1](https://github.com/timchurches/blog/tree/master/_posts/2020-02-18-analysing-covid-19-2019-ncov-outbreak-data-with-r-part-1){target="_blank"} and [part 2](https://github.com/timchurches/blog/tree/master/_posts/2020-03-01-analysing-covid-19-2019-ncov-outbreak-data-with-r-part-2){target="_blank"}).

Part 1 is actually based on another shorter blog post by Prof. Dr. Holger K. von Jouanne-Diedrich from [Learning Machines](https://blog.ephorie.de/){target="_blank"}. Read his [article](https://blog.ephorie.de/epidemiology-how-contagious-is-novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov){target="_blank"} for a more concise analysis on how to model the outbreak of the coronavirus and discover how contagious it is. Note that I have personally written an article analyzing [COVID-19 in Belgium](/blog/covid-19-in-belgium/) based on articles from these two authors.

More recently, Tim Churches published a series of other interesting articles:

* Modelling the effect of various public health interventions on the local epidemic spread of COVID-19 infection using stochastic individual compartmental models (ICMs) implemented by the `{EpiModel}` package for R:
  + [Part 1](https://timchurches.github.io/blog/posts/2020-03-10-modelling-the-effects-of-public-health-interventions-on-covid-19-transmission-part-1/){target="_blank"} (code [here](https://github.com/timchurches/blog/tree/master/_posts/2020-03-10-modelling-the-effects-of-public-health-interventions-on-covid-19-transmission-part-1){target="_blank"})

* [The use of simulations to explore the effects of various interventions on COVID-19 spread](https://rviews.rstudio.com/2020/03/19/simulating-covid-19-interventions-with-r/){target="_blank"}
* [COVID-19 epidemiology with R](https://rviews.rstudio.com/2020/03/05/covid-19-epidemiology-with-r/){target="_blank"}: in this blog post, the author, using relatively early and partial US data, separates out inbound from community cases, and predicts the next few weeks of incident numbers. He also highlights several R functions to analyze a disease outbreak.
* [We can "shrink" the COVID-19 curve, rather than just flatten it](https://newsroom.unsw.edu.au/news/health/we-can-shrink-covid-19-curve-rather-just-flatten-it){target="_blank"} (in collaboration with Louisa Jorm)

## COVID-19 Data Analysis with `{tidyverse}` and `{ggplot2}`

![](/blog/top-r-resources-on-coronavirus_files/Coronavirus - cases by country in R.png){width=100%}

[Dr. Yanchang Zhao](http://yanchang.rdatamining.com/){target="_blank"} from RDataMining published a data analysis around the Coronavirus with the `{tidyverse}` and `{ggplot2}` packages, for [China](http://www.rdatamining.com/docs/Coronavirus-data-analysis-china.pdf){target="_blank"} and [world wide](http://www.rdatamining.com/docs/Coronavirus-data-analysis-world.pdf){target="_blank"}.

Both documents are a mix of data cleaning, data processing and visualizations of the confirmed/cured cases and death rates across countries or regions.

## COVID-19 cumulative observed case fatality rate over time

![](/blog/top-r-resources-on-coronavirus_files/COVID-19 cumulative observed case fatality rate over time.png){width=100%}

Written by [Peter Ellis](http://freerangestats.info/){target="_blank"}, this [article](http://freerangestats.info/blog/2020/03/17/covid19-cfr){target="_blank"} focuses on how the observed case fatality rate of COVID-19 has evolved over time across 7 countries and comments on why the rates vary (low testing rates, age of the population, overwhelmed hospitals, etc.).

The code is available at the end of the article. The data is from John Hopkins and it uses the [`{coronavirus} package`](/blog/top-r-resources-on-covid-19-coronavirus/#coronavirus).

More recently, the author published two other articles:

* [Impact of a country's age breakdown on COVID-19 case fatality rate](http://freerangestats.info/blog/2020/03/21/covid19-cfr-demographics){target="_blank"}: it looks at estimated fatalities in different countries according to the age distributions in those countries (based on Italy's data). The data is from The Istituto Superiore di Sanità (Roma) and all the code is shown in the post.

## Covid 19 Tracking

![](/blog/top-r-resources-on-coronavirus_files/Coronavirus Covid 19 Tracking.png){width=100%}

Written by [Prof. Kieran Healy](https://kieranhealy.org/){target="_blank"}, this [article](https://kieranhealy.org/blog/archives/2020/03/21/covid-19-tracking/){target="_blank"} discusses how to get an overview of best-available counts of deaths, using the [COVID-19 Data from the European Centers for Disease Control](https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications-data/download-todays-data-geographic-distribution-covid-19-cases-worldwide){target="_blank"}.

Code can be found in the article and on [GitHub](https://github.com/kjhealy/covid){target="_blank"}.

More recently, the author published three other articles:

1. [A COVID Small Multiple](https://kieranhealy.org/blog/archives/2020/03/27/a-covid-small-multiple/){target="_blank"}: this article discusses how to create a small-multiple plot of cases by country, showing the trajectory of the outbreak for a large number of countries, with the background of each small-multiple panel also showing (in grey) the trajectory of every other country for comparison.

2. [Apple's COVID Mobility Data](https://kieranhealy.org/blog/archives/2020/04/23/apples-covid-mobility-data/){target="_blank"}: this article uses Apple's time series mobility data for several cities and countries (via the [`{covdata}` package](https://www.statsandr.com/blog/top-r-resources-on-covid-19-coronavirus/#covdata)) to plot three modes of getting around: driving, public transit, and walking. The series begins on January 13th indexed to 100 at the beginning of the series, so trends are relative to that baseline.

## Infectious diseases and nonlinear differential equations

![](/blog/top-r-resources-on-coronavirus_files/Infectious diseases and nonlinear differential equations.png){width=100%}

Published by [Fabian Dablander](https://fabiandablander.com/){target="_blank"}, this math intensive [blog post](https://fabiandablander.com/r/Nonlinear-Infection.html){target="_blank"} explains what SIR and SIRS models take into account and how they calculate their results.

From a pandemic perspective, the author writes "The SIRS model extends the SIR model, allowing the recovered population to become susceptible again (hence the extra 'S'). It assumes that the susceptible population increases proportional to the recovered population".

## Epidemic modelling of COVID-19 in the UK using an SIR model

![](/blog/top-r-resources-on-coronavirus_files/Epidemic modelling of COVID-19 in the UK using an SIR model.png){width=100%}

Published by [Thomas Wilding](https://tjwilding.wordpress.com/){target="_blank"}, this [blog post](https://tjwilding.wordpress.com/2020/03/20/epidemic-modelling-of-covid-19-in-the-uk-using-an-sir-model/){target="_blank"} applies the SIR model to UK data.

As further extensions to the model, the author suggests:

* Using an SEIR model (adding an Exposed compartment for people who are infected but not yet infectious)
* Adding a "Q" layer since a lot of people are being Quarantined or isolated
* Considering the "hidden"" population that is infected but is denied being tested due to shortage of tests
* Feasibility of a second wave / outbreak of the epidemic later in the year (as seen in previous outbreaks, such as Swine Flu)

## Modeling Pandemics

![](/blog/top-r-resources-on-coronavirus_files/MODELING PANDEMICS.png){width=100%}

Published by [Arthur Charpentier](https://freakonometrics.hypotheses.org/author/freakonometrics){target="_blank"}, this series of 3 blog post ([part 1](https://freakonometrics.hypotheses.org/60482){target="_blank"}, [part 2](https://freakonometrics.hypotheses.org/60543){target="_blank"}, [part 3](https://freakonometrics.hypotheses.org/60514){target="_blank"}) walks through the SIR model and its parameters, how ODEquations solves it, and generating the reproductive rate. It also gives a mathematical explanation of a model for how quickly a pandemic will return, albeit with diminishing intensity. Last, it explains a model that is more sophisticated than SIR, the SEIR model, and illustrates it with Ebola data.

More recently, the author published another [article](https://freakonometrics.hypotheses.org/60900){target="_blank"} which examines what proportion of the population in various U.S. states have been tested for the novel coronavirus and tries to answer the following two questions:

1. How many people are tested on a daily basis?
1. What are we actually testing for?

## COVID-19: The Case of Germany

![](/blog/top-r-resources-on-coronavirus_files/COVID-19 The Case of Germany.png){width=100%}

Published by Prof. Dr. Holger K. von Jouanne-Diedrich from [Learning Machines](https://blog.ephorie.de/){target="_blank"}, this [blog post](https://blog.ephorie.de/covid-19-the-case-of-germany){target="_blank"} uses the SIR model and German data to estimate the duration and severity of the pandemic.

Download the data from [Morgenpost](https://interaktiv.morgenpost.de/corona-virus-karte-infektionen-deutschland-weltweit/data/Coronavirus.history.v2.csv){target="_blank"}.

More recently, the author published two other articles:

1. [COVID-19 in the US: Back-of-the-Envelope Calculation of Actual Infections and Future Deaths](https://blog.ephorie.de/covid-19-in-the-us-back-of-the-envelope-calculation-of-actual-infections-and-future-deaths){target="_blank"}: Working back from reported deaths from Covid19, the post shows how to estimate infections at a prior date, based on several assumptions about fatality rates and infected periods (and acknowledging many unknowns and data problems).
1. [How to analyze mobility trends with R](https://blog.ephorie.de/covid-19-analyze-mobility-trends-with-r){target="_blank"} using anonymized and aggregated [Apple's mobility data](https://www.apple.com/covid19/mobility){target="_blank"} available to the public. The article presents a R function to return the data in a well-structured format for countries and major cities, and to visualize the drop in vehicular and pedestrian movement caused by the pandemic.

## Flatten the COVID-19 Curve

![](/blog/top-r-resources-on-coronavirus_files/Flatten the COVID-19 curve.png){width=100%}

Published by [Michael Höhle](https://staff.math.su.se/hoehle/){target="_blank"} from Theory meets practice, this [blog post](https://staff.math.su.se/hoehle/blog/2020/03/16/flatteningthecurve.html){target="_blank"} discusses why the message of flattening the COVID-19 curve is right, but why some of the visualizations used to show the effect are wrong: Reducing the basic reproduction number does not just stretch the outbreak, it also reduces the final size of the outbreak.

From a pandemic point of view, the author writes "Because of limited health capacities, stretching out the outbreak over a longer time period will ensure, that a larger proportion of those in need of hospital treatment will actually get it. Other advantages of this approach are to win time in order to find better treatment forms and, possibly, to eventually develop a vaccine".

A [Shiny app](/blog/top-r-resources-on-covid-19-coronavirus/#flatten-the-curve) has also been built upon this article to investigate different scenarios.

In a second article entitled "[Effective reproduction number estimation](https://staff.math.su.se/hoehle/blog/2020/04/15/effectiveR0.html){target="_blank"}", Michael Höhle estimates with the `{R0}` package the time-varying effective reproduction number during an infectious disease outbreak such as COVID-19. Using a single simulated outbreak he compares the performance of three different estimation methods.

## COVID-19 in Belgium

![](/blog/top-r-resources-on-coronavirus_files/COVID-19 Coronavirus in Belgium.png){width=100%}

Based on Tim Churches' article, I published an [analysis of the COVID-19 specifically for Belgium](/blog/covid-19-in-belgium/). In this article, I also use the most common epidemiological model, the SIR model (to its simplest form), to analyze the outbreak of the disease in the case where there would be no public health intervention. I also show how to compute the reproduction number and I present some additional improvements that can be made to further analyze the epidemic.

The code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/AntoineSoetewey/statsandr/blob/master/content/blog/2020-03-31-covid-19-in-belgium.Rmd){target="_blank"}, so feel free to use it as starting point for an analysis of the virus outbreak in your own country.

Thanks for reading. I hope you will find these R resources on the COVID-19 Coronavirus useful. Feel free to let me know in the comments if I missed one.^[If you are the author of one of these resources, do not hesitate to [contact me](/contact/) if you see any inconsistency or if you would like to remove it from this article.] A special thanks to Rees Morrison for his tremendous work on collecting and organizing several articles, which greatly helped in improving the section about blog posts.

Although I have carefully read all resources, inclusion on the list does not mean that I endorse the findings. Moreover, some of the analyses, code, dashboards, packages or datasets might be out of date, so these should not be viewed, by default, as current findings.
