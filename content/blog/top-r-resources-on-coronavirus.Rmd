The Coronavirus is a serious concern around the globe. With its expansion, there are also more and more online resources about it. This article presents a selection of the best R resources on the COVID-19 virus.

This list is by no means exhaustive. I am not aware of all R resources available online about the Coronavirus, so please feel free to let me know in the comments or by [contacting me](/contact/) if you believe that another resource (R package, Shiny app, R code, data, etc.) deserves to be on this list.

# R Shiny apps and dashboards

## Coronavirus tracker

![](/blog/top-r-resources-on-coronavirus_files/r-shiny-app-coronavirus-john-coene.png){width=100%}

Developed by [John Coene](https://john-coene.com/){target="_blank"}, this [Shiny app](https://shiny.john-coene.com/coronavirus/){target="_blank"} tracks the spread of the coronavirus, based on three data sources (John Hopkins, Weixin and DXY Data). The Shiny app, built with shinyMobile (which makes it responsive on different screen sizes), presents in a really nice way the number of deaths, confirmed, suspected and recovered cases by time and region.

The code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/JohnCoene/coronavirus){target="_blank"}.

## Coronavirus dashboard from the `{coronavirus} package`

![](/blog/top-r-resources-on-coronavirus_files/Coronavirus dashboard from the coronavirus R package.png){width=100%}

Developed by the author of the [`{coronavirus} package`](/blog/top-r-resources-on-covid-19-coronavirus/#coronavirus), this [dashboard](https://ramikrispin.github.io/coronavirus_dashboard/){target="_blank"} provides an overview of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus COVID-19 (2019-nCoV) epidemic. The data and dashboard are refreshed on a daily basis.

The code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/RamiKrispin/coronavirus_dashboard){target="_blank"}.

From this dashboard, I created another [dashboard specific to Belgium](https://www.antoinesoetewey.com/files/coronavirus-dashboard.html){target="_blank"}. The code is also available on [GitHub](https://github.com/AntoineSoetewey/coronavirus_dashboard){target="_blank"}.

## COVID-19 Global Cases

![](/blog/top-r-resources-on-coronavirus_files/COVID-19 Global Cases Shiny dashboard.png){width=100%}

# R packages

## `{nCov2019}`

![](/blog/top-r-resources-on-coronavirus_files/nCov2019 R package for studying COVID-19 coronavirus outbreak.png){width=100%}

The [`{nCov2019}` package](https://github.com/GuangchuangYu/nCov2019){target="_blank"} gives you access to epidemiological data on the coronavirus outbreak.^[The package has also been the subject of a [preprint](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.25.20027433){target="_blank"}.] The package gives real-time statistics, includes historical data and a Shiny app. The [vignette](https://guangchuangyu.github.io/nCov2019/){target="_blank"} explains the main functions and possibilities of the package.

Furthermore, the authors of the package also developed a [website](http://www.bcloud.org/e/){target="_blank"} with interactive plots and time-series forecasts, which could be useful in informing the public and studying how the virus spread in populous countries.

## `{coronavirus}`

![](/blog/top-r-resources-on-coronavirus_files/coronavirus R package.png)

Developed by [Rami Krispin](https://ramikrispin.github.io/){target="_blank"}, the [`{coronavirus} package`](https://github.com/RamiKrispin/coronavirus){target="_blank"} provides a tidy format dataset of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus COVID-19 (2019-nCoV) epidemic. Pulled from the dataset of [John Hopkins](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19){target="_blank"}, the R package gives a daily summary of the coronavirus cases by state/province. The data set contains various variables such as confirmed cases, death, and recovered across different states.

More details are available [here](https://ramikrispin.github.io/coronavirus/){target="_blank"}, a `csv` format of the package dataset is available [here](https://github.com/RamiKrispin/coronavirus-csv){target="_blank"} and a summary dashboard is available [here](https://ramikrispin.github.io/coronavirus_dashboard/){target="_blank"}.

## Analyzing COVID-19 outbreak data with R

![](/blog/top-r-resources-on-coronavirus_files/Analyzing COVID-19 outbreak data with R.png){width=100%}

Written by [Tim Churches](https://timchurches.github.io/){target="_blank"}, these two articles ([part 1](https://timchurches.github.io/blog/posts/2020-02-18-analysing-covid-19-2019-ncov-outbreak-data-with-r-part-1/){target="_blank"} and [part 2](https://timchurches.github.io/blog/posts/2020-03-01-analysing-covid-19-2019-ncov-outbreak-data-with-r-part-2/){target="_blank"}) explore the R tools and packages that might be used to analyze the COVID-19 data. Moreover, it presents R code to analyze how contagious is the Coronavirus thanks to the SIR model (an epidemiological model).

The code is available on GitHub ([part 1](https://github.com/timchurches/blog/tree/master/_posts/2020-02-18-analysing-covid-19-2019-ncov-outbreak-data-with-r-part-1){target="_blank"} and [part 2](https://github.com/timchurches/blog/tree/master/_posts/2020-03-01-analysing-covid-19-2019-ncov-outbreak-data-with-r-part-2){target="_blank"}).

Part 1 is actually based on another shorter blog post by Prof. Dr. Holger K. von Jouanne-Diedrich from [Learning Machines](https://blog.ephorie.de/){target="_blank"}. Read his article [here](https://blog.ephorie.de/epidemiology-how-contagious-is-novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov){target="_blank"} for a more concise analysis on how to model the outbreak of the coronavirus and discover how contagious it is.

More recently, the author published a series of other interesting articles: 

* Modelling the effects of public health interventions on COVID-19 transmission using R:

## COVID-19 Data Analysis with `{tidyverse}` and `{ggplot2}`

![](/blog/top-r-resources-on-coronavirus_files/Coronavirus - cases by country in R.png){width=100%}

[Dr. Yanchang Zhao](http://yanchang.rdatamining.com/){target="_blank"} from RDataMining published a data analysis around the Coronavirus with the `{tidyverse}` and `{ggplot2}` packages, for [China](http://www.rdatamining.com/docs/Coronavirus-data-analysis-china.pdf){target="_blank"} and [world wide](http://www.rdatamining.com/docs/Coronavirus-data-analysis-world.pdf){target="_blank"}.

Both documents are a mix of data cleaning, data processing and visualizations of the confirmed/cured cases and death rates across countries or regions.

## COVID-19 cumulative observed case fatality rate over time

![](/blog/top-r-resources-on-coronavirus_files/COVID-19 cumulative observed case fatality rate over time.png){width=100%}

Written by [Peter Ellis](http://freerangestats.info/){target="_blank"}, this [article](http://freerangestats.info/blog/2020/03/17/covid19-cfr){target="_blank"} focuses on how the observed case fatality rate of COVID-19 has evolved over time.

The code is available at the end of the article. The data is from John Hopkins and it uses the [`{coronavirus} package`](/blog/top-r-resources-on-covid-19-coronavirus/#coronavirus).

More recently, the author published a new [article](http://freerangestats.info/blog/2020/03/21/covid19-cfr-demographics){target="_blank"} on the impact of a country's age breakdown on COVID-19 case fatality rate. The code is available at the end of the article.

## Covid 19 Tracking

![](/blog/top-r-resources-on-coronavirus_files/Coronavirus Covid 19 Tracking.png){width=100%}

Written by [Kieran Healy](https://kieranhealy.org/){target="_blank"}, this [article](https://kieranhealy.org/blog/archives/2020/03/21/covid-19-tracking/){target="_blank"} discusses how to get an overview of best-available counts of deaths, using the [COVID-19 Data from the European Centers for Disease Control](https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications-data/download-todays-data-geographic-distribution-covid-19-cases-worldwide){target="_blank"}.
