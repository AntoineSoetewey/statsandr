The Coronavirus is a serious concern around the globe. With its expansion, there are also more and more online resources about it. This article presents a selection of the best R resources on the COVID-19 virus.

This list is by no means exhaustive. I am not aware of all R resources available online about the Coronavirus, so please feel free to let me know in the comments or by [contacting me](/contact/) if you believe that another resource (R package, Shiny app, R code, data, etc.) deserves to be on this list.

# R Shiny apps

## Coronavirus tracker

Developed by John Coene, this [Shiny app](https://shiny.john-coene.com/coronavirus/) tracks the spread of the coronavirus, based on three data sources (John Hopkins, Weixin and DXY Data). The Shiny app, built with shinyMobile (which makes it responsive on different screen sizes), presents in a really nice way the number of deaths, confirmed, suspected and recovered cases by time and region.

The code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/JohnCoene/coronavirus).

## Coronavirus (COVID-19) across the world

![](/blog/top-r-resources-on-coronavirus_files/shiny app Coronavirus (COVID-19) Across The World.png){width=100%}

Developed by Anisa Dhana in collaboration with datascience+, this [Shiny app](https://dash.datascienceplus.com/covid19/) monitors the spread of COVID-19 across the world via a map visualization of the confirmed cases and some graphs on the growth of the virus.

The dataset used is from [Johns Hopkins CSSE](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19) and part of the code is available in this [blog post](https://datascienceplus.com/map-visualization-of-covid19-across-world).

## COVID-19 outbreak

Developed by the department of Public Health of the Strasbourg University Hospital and the Laboratory of Biostatistics and Medical Informatics of the Strasbourg Medicine Faculty, this [Shiny app](https://thibautfabacher.shinyapps.io/covid-19/) shows an interactive map for global monitoring of the infection. It focuses on the evolution of the number of cases per country and for a given period in terms of incidence and prevalence.

The code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/DrFabach/Corona/blob/master/shiny.r).

## Comparing Corona trajectories

This [Shiny app](https://andrecalerovaldez.shinyapps.io/CovidTimeSeries/) will help to compare the number of confirmed and deceased cases together with case trajectories by country via two graphs. The app also allows you to compare growth rates by country via a table.

# R packages

## `{nCov2019}`

![](/blog/top-r-resources-on-coronavirus_files/nCov2019 R package for studying COVID-19 coronavirus outbreak.png){width=100%}

The [`{nCov2019}` package](https://github.com/GuangchuangYu/nCov2019) gives you access to epidemiological data on the coronavirus outbreak.^[The package has also been the subject of a [preprint](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.25.20027433).] The package gives real-time statistics and includes historical data. The [vignette](https://guangchuangyu.github.io/nCov2019/) explains the main functions and possibilities of the package.

Furthermore, the authors of the package also developed a [website](http://www.bcloud.org/e/) with interactive plots and time-series forecasts, which could be useful in informing the public and studying how the virus spread in populous countries.

# R code

## Analyzing COVID-19 outbreak data with R

![](/blog/top-r-resources-on-coronavirus_files/Analysing COVID-19 (2019-nCoV) outbreak data with R.png){width=100%}

Written by Tim Churches, these two articles ([part 1](https://timchurches.github.io/blog/posts/2020-02-18-analysing-covid-19-2019-ncov-outbreak-data-with-r-part-1/) and [part 2](https://timchurches.github.io/blog/posts/2020-03-01-analysing-covid-19-2019-ncov-outbreak-data-with-r-part-2/)) explore the R tools and packages that might be used to analyze the COVID-19 data. Moreover, it presents R code to analyze how contagious is the Coronavirus thanks to the SIR model (an epidemiological model).

The code is available on GitHub ([part 1](https://github.com/timchurches/blog/tree/master/_posts/2020-02-18-analysing-covid-19-2019-ncov-outbreak-data-with-r-part-1) and [part 2](https://github.com/timchurches/blog/tree/master/_posts/2020-03-01-analysing-covid-19-2019-ncov-outbreak-data-with-r-part-2)).

Part 1 is actually based on another shorter blog post by Holger K. von Jouanne-Diedrich from [Learning Machines](https://blog.ephorie.de/). Read his article [here](https://blog.ephorie.de/epidemiology-how-contagious-is-novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov) for a more concise analysis on how to model the outbreak of the coronavirus and discover how contagious it is.

## COVID-19 Data Analysis with `{tidyverse}` and `{ggplot2}`

![](/blog/top-r-resources-on-coronavirus_files/Coronavirus - cases by country in R.png){width=100%}

An analysis of data around the Coronavirus with the `{tidyverse}` and `{ggplot2}` packages, for [China](http://www.rdatamining.com/docs/Coronavirus-data-analysis-china.pdf) and [world wide](http://www.rdatamining.com/docs/Coronavirus-data-analysis-world.pdf).

Both documents are a mix of data cleaning, data processing and visualizations of the confirmed/cured cases and death rates across countries or regions.

# Data

* [2019 Novel Coronavirus COVID-19 (2019-nCoV) Data Repository by Johns Hopkins CSSE](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19)
