The Coronavirus is a serious concern around the globe. With its expansion, there are also more and more online resources about it. This article presents a selection of the best R resources on the COVID-19 virus.

This list is by no means exhaustive. I am not aware of all R resources available online about the Coronavirus, so please feel free to let me know in the comments or by [contacting me](/contact/) if you believe that another resource (R package, Shiny app, R code, etc.) deserves to be on this list.

# R Shiny apps

## 1

![](/blog/top-r-resources-on-coronavirus_files/r-shiny-app-coronavirus-john-coene.png){width=100%}

Developed by John Coene, this [Shiny app](https://shiny.john-coene.com/coronavirus/) tracks the spread of the coronavirus, based on three data sources (John Hopkins, Weixin and DXY Data). The Shiny app, built with shinyMobile (which makes it responsive on different screen sizes), presents in a really nice way the number of deaths, confirmed, suspected and recovered cases by time and region.

The code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/JohnCoene/coronavirus).

Developed by the departement of Public Health of the Strasbourg University Hospital and the Laboratory of Biostatistics and Medical Informatics of the Strasbourg Medicine Faculty, this [Shiny app](https://thibautfabacher.shinyapps.io/covid-19/) shows an interactive map for global monitoring of the infection. It focuses on the evolution of the number of cases per country and for a given period in terms of incidence and prevalence.

The code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/DrFabach/Corona/blob/master/shiny.r).

# R packages

The [`{nCov2019}` package](https://github.com/GuangchuangYu/nCov2019) gives you access to epidemiological data on the coronavirus outbreak.^[The package has also been the subject of a [preprint](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.25.20027433).] The package gives real-time statistics and includes historical data. The [vignette](https://guangchuangyu.github.io/nCov2019/) explains the main functions and possibilities of the package.

Furthermore, the authors of the package also developed a [website](http://www.bcloud.org/e/) with interactive plots and time-series forecasts, which could be useful in informing the public and studying how the virus spread in populous countries.

# R code

![](/blog/top-r-resources-on-coronavirus_files/data-analysis-coronavirus-tidyverse-ggplot2.png){width=100%}

An analysis of data around the Coronavirus with the `{tidyverse}` and `{ggplot2}` packages, for [China](http://www.rdatamining.com/docs/Coronavirus-data-analysis-china.pdf) and [world wide](http://www.rdatamining.com/docs/
Coronavirus-data-analysis-world.pdf).

Both documents are a mix of data cleaning, data processing and visualizations of the confirmed/cured cases and death rates across countries or regions.

This [blog post](https://blog.ephorie.de/epidemiology-how-contagious-is-novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov) presents R code to analyze how contagious is the Coronavirus thanks to the SIR model (an epidemiological model).

Written by Tim Churches, these two articles ([part 1](https://timchurches.github.io/blog/posts/2020-02-18-analysing-covid-19-2019-ncov-outbreak-data-with-r-part-1/) and [part 2](https://timchurches.github.io/blog/posts/2020-03-01-analysing-covid-19-2019-ncov-outbreak-data-with-r-part-2/)) explore the R tools and packages that might be used to analyze the COVID-19 data.
