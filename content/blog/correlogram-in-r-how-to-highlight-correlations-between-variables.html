<p>Correlations are used to study the relationship between two variables and are often computed as part of <a href="/blog/descriptive-statistics-in-r">descriptive statistics</a>.</p>
<p>Correlations are measured between only 2 variables at a time. Therefore, for datasets with many variables, computing correlations can become quite cumbersome and time consuming. A solution to this problem is to compute correlations and display them in a correlation matrix, which shows correlation coefficients for all possible combinations of two variables in the dataset.</p>
<p>For example, below is the correlation matrix for the dataset <code>mtcars</code> (which, as described by the help documentation of R, comprises fuel consumption and 10 aspects of automobile design and performance for 32 automobiles):<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

<p>Even after rounding the correlation coefficients to 2 digits, you will conceive that this correlation matrix is not easily and quickly interpretable.</p>
<p>If you are using <a href="/blog/getting-started-in-r-markdown">R Markdown</a>, you can use the <code>pander()</code> function to make it slightly more readable, but still, we must admit that this table is not optimal when it comes to visualizing correlations between several variables of a dataset, especially for large datasets.</p>
<p>To tackle this issue and make it much more insightful, let’s transform the correlation matrix into a correlation plot. A correlation plot, also referred as a correlogram, allows to highlight the variables that are most (positively and negatively) correlated. Below an example with the same dataset presented above:</p>
<p><img src="/blog/correlogram-in-r-how-to-highlight-correlations-between-variables_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>The correlogram represents the correlations for all pairs of variables. Positive correlations are displayed in blue and negative correlations in red. The intensity of the color is proportional to the correlation coefficient so the stronger the correlation (i.e., the closer to -1 or 1), the darker the boxes. The color legend on the right hand side of the correlogram shows the correlation coefficients and the corresponding colors.</p>
<p>As a reminder, a negative correlation implies that the two variables under consideration vary in opposite directions, that is, if one variable increases the other decreases and vice versa. A positive correlation implies that the two variables under consideration vary in the same direction, that is, if one variable increases the other increases and if one variable decreases the other decreases as well.</p>
<p>Finally, a white box indicates that the correlation is not significantly different from 0 at the specified significance level (in this example, at <span class="math inline">\(\alpha = 5\)</span>%) for the couple of variables. A correlation not significantly different from 0 means that there is <strong>no linear</strong> relationship between the two variables considered.</p>
<p>To determine whether a specific correlation coefficient is significantly different from 0, a correlation test has been performed. Remind that the null and alternative hypotheses of this test are:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span>: <span class="math inline">\(\rho = 0\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(H_1\)</span>: <span class="math inline">\(\rho \ne 0\)</span></li>
</ul>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span> is the correlation coefficient. The correlation test is based on two factors: the number of observations and the correlation coefficient. The more observations and the stronger the correlation, the more likely it is to reject the null hypothesis of no correlation.</p>
<p>In the context of our example, the correlograms above shows that the variables <code>cyl</code> (the number of cylinders) and <code>hp</code> (horsepower) are positively correlated, while the variables <code>mpg</code> (miles per gallon) and <code>wt</code> (weight) are negatively correlated. Furthermore, the variables <code>gear</code> and <code>carb</code> are not correlated. Even if the correlation coefficient is 0.27 between the 2 variables, the correlation test has shown that we cannot reject the hypothesis of no correlation. This is the reason the box for these two variable is white.</p>
<p>Althought this correlogram presents exactly the same information than the correlation matrix, the correlogram presents a visual representation of the correlation matrix, allowing to quickly scan through it to see which variables are correlated and which are not.</p>
<p>For those interested to draw this correlogram with their own data, here is the function I adapted based on the <code>corrplot()</code> function from the <code>{corrplot}</code> package (thanks to all contributors of this package):</p>

<p>In this article, we present the Pearson correlations (because we study the relationship between <strong>continuous quantitative</strong> variables) between all the variables considered via a correlogram (graph representing the matrix of correlations). The correlogram makes it possible to highlight the most correlated variables :</p>
