# Introduction

At the end of one of the training sessions I gave on R, a student asked me the following question:

> How do you keep yourself updated with the latest R news?

It is true that R, being open source (meaning that everyone can contribute), is evolving rapidly. This means that even if I am using R for several years and on a daily basis, I like to stay informed in order to stay up to date with the program and the latest coding practices.

In fact, I learn about new packages, new functions and new features almost everyday. Most of them are not particularly useful for my research or my teaching tasks, but sometimes I discover such a nice package or function that I replace my code with new one.^[See for example this [article](/blog/how-to-do-a-t-test-or-anova-for-many-variables-at-once-in-r-and-communicate-the-results-in-a-better-way/#update-with-the-ggstatsplot-package). The package I discovered was so useful and interesting (to me), that I added a new section to the post and now use it instead of the older package.]

The training was an advanced one, so the student had a good knowledge of R and was not looking for more tutorials or courses. She was interested in knowing where to look for updates about current and new R packages and functions.

After sharing my sources with all students following the training, I thought it would be useful to others. In this article, I share my sources---from where I get the latest R updates and news. The sources are divided into two main categories: **Twitter and newsletters.**

# How do I keep track?

## Twitter

To be honest, I mostly use Twitter to keep up to date with R news.

Twitter allows me to follow discussions about statistical methods or approaches, and to keep me informed about publications of new blog posts.

What I particularly like with Twitter is that there is a mix between:

- short messages about new functions or packages (most of the time with an illustration or an example), and
- announcements of new blog posts that cover specific subjects in details.

For this, I follow people (researchers, professors, bloggers, statisticians, data scientists, etc.) that are working in my domains of interest. For instance, I am mostly interested in the application of statistics in R, data science, biostatistics and data visualization. I thus follow accounts which regularly post about these topics. I also avoid following accounts that cover topics I am not interested in, so that my Twitter feed really shows information I am most likely to be interested in.

Below, you will see a list of some of the accounts I follow, classified by themes. Of course, this is a **non-exhaustive list!** There are plenty of very inspiring and intelligent people that are not in the list, simply because I cannot afford to put them all.

If you follow people that post regularly about the themes covered below, feel free to add them in the comments. I am always looking for new inspiring accounts to follow.

*Note that the accounts are displayed in alphabetical order and the table is searchable.*

```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
dat <- read_sheet("https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Ev9FwX8xLH1gaPNRaxh_EPCBV6QjMCGINlYvZ7UXnWM/edit?usp=sharing")

# create table
dat$Username <- substring(dat$URL, first = 21)
dat$Link <- paste0("<a href='", dat$URL, "' target='_blank'>@", dat$Username, "</a>")
dat <- dat %>%
  select(Name,
         Category,
         Link)

# display table
n <- nrow(dat)
datatable(dat,
  extensions = "Buttons",
  rownames = FALSE,
  filter = "top",
  options = list(
    pageLength = n,
    order = list(0, "asc"),
    autoWidth = TRUE,
    dom = "Blfrtip",
    buttons = c("copy", "csv", "excel", "pdf", "print")
  ),
  escape = FALSE
)
```

You will also find many news when exploring [#rstats](https://twitter.com/hashtag/rstats?src=hashtag_click) on Twitter.

## Newsletters

Besides Twitter, I also read new blog posts through these newsletters:

- [R-Bloggers](https://www.r-bloggers.com/) (daily)
- [R Weekly](https://rweekly.org/) (weekly)

These newsletters are actually blog aggregators, so collections of many many blogs. If you have your own blog, don't hesitate to submit it to make it accessible to more people.

# Conclusion

Thanks for reading. I hope this article will help you to keep track of great blogs, tutorials and other resources about R. Feel free to follow me on Twitter ([@statsandr](https://twitter.com/statsandr)), where I tweet my new articles and retweet everything I find interesting or worth mentioning.

As always, if you have a question or a suggestion related to the topic covered in this article, please add it as a comment so other readers can benefit from the discussion.
