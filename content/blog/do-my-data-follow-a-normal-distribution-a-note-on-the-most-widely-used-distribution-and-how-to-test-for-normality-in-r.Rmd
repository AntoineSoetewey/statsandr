# What is a normal distribution?

The normal distribution is a function that defines how a set of measurements is distributed around the center of these measurements (i.e., the mean). Many natural phenomena in real life can be approximated by a bell-shaped frequency distribution known as a normal distribution or the Gaussian distribution.

The normal distribution is a mount-shaped, unimodal and symmetric distribution where most measurements gather around the mean. Moreover, the further a measure deviates from the mean, the lower the probability. In this sense, for a given variable, it is common to find values close to the mean, but less and less likely to have values as we move away from the mean. Last but not least, since the normal distribution is symmetric around its mean, extreme values in both tails of the distribution are equivalently unlikely. For instance, given that adult height follows a normal distribution, most adults are close to the average height and extremely short adults occur as infrequently as extremely tall adults.

In this article, the focus is on understanding the normal distribution, the associated empirical rule, its parameters and how to compute $Z$-scores to find probabilities (illustrated with examples). As it is a requirement in many statistical tests, we also show 3 complementary methods to test the normality assumption in R.

# Empirical rule

Data possessing an approximately normal distribution have a definite variation, as expressed by the following empirical rule:

* $\mu \pm \sigma$ includes approximately 68% of the observations
* $\mu \pm 2 \cdot \sigma$ includes approximately 95% of the observations
* $\mu \pm 3 \cdot \sigma$ includes almost all of the observations (99.7% to be more precise)

![Normal distribution & empirical rule. Source: Wikipedia](/blog/do-my-data-follow-a-normal-distribution-a-note-on-the-most-widely-used-distribution-and-how-to-test-for-normality-in-r_files/Empirical_Rule-normal-distribution.webp)

where $\mu$ and $\sigma$ correspond to the population mean and population standard deviation, respectively.

The empirical rule is illustred by the following 2 examples. Suppose that the scores of an exam in statistics given to all students in a Belgian university are known to have, approximately, a normal distribution with mean $\mu = 67$ and standard deviation $\sigma = 9$. It can then be deduced that approximately 68% of the scores are between 58 and 76, that approximately 95% of the scores are between 49 and 85, and that almost all of the scores (99.7%) are between 40 and 94. Thus, knowing the mean and the standard deviation gives us a fairly good picture of the distribution of scores. Now suppose that a single university student is randomly selected from those who took the exam. What is the probability that her score will be between 49 and 85? Based on the empirical rule, we find that 0.95 is a reasonable answer to this probability question.

The utility and value of the empirical rule are due to the common occurrence of approximately normal distributions of measurements in nature. For example, IQ, shoe size, height, birth weight, etc. are approximately normally-distributed. You will find that approximately 95% of these measurements will be within $2\sigma$ of their mean [@wackerly2014mathematical].

# Parameters

Like many probability distributions, the shape and probabilities of the normal distribution is defined entirely by some parameters. The normal distribution has two parameters: (i) the [mean $\mu$](/blog/descriptive-statistics-by-hand/#mean/) and (ii) the [variance $\sigma^2$](/blog/descriptive-statistics-by-hand/#variance/) (the square of the [standard deviation $\sigma$](/blog/descriptive-statistics-by-hand/#standard-deviation/)). The mean $\mu$ locates the center of the distribution, that is, the central tendency of the observations, and the variance $\sigma^2$ defines the width of the distribution, that is, the spread of the observations.

The mean $\mu$ can take on any finite value, whereas the variance $\sigma^2$ can assume any positive finite value (i.e., $\sigma^2 > 0$). The shape of the normal distribution changes based on these two parameters. Since there is an infinite number of combinations of the mean and variance, there is an infinite number of normal distributions, and thus an infinite number of forms.

For instance, see how the shapes of the normal distributions vary when the two parameters change:

```{r, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(reshape2)

set.seed(42)
dat <- data.frame(Normal_dist1 = rnorm(1000000, mean = 80, sd = 4),
                  Normal_dist2 = rnorm(1000000, mean = 100, sd = 4),
                  Normal_dist3 = rnorm(1000000, mean = 120, sd = 4))

names(dat) <- c("mean = 80",
                "mean = 100",
                "mean = 120")

dat <- melt(dat)
ggplot(dat) +
 aes(x = value, fill = variable) +
 geom_density(alpha=0.25) +
 scale_fill_hue() +
 labs(title = "Normal distributions with different means", fill = "Distributions", subtitle = "Variance = 16") +
 theme_minimal()

dat <- data.frame(Normal_dist1 = rnorm(1000000, mean = 100, sd = 3),
                  Normal_dist2 = rnorm(1000000, mean = 100, sd = 6),
                  Normal_dist3 = rnorm(1000000, mean = 100, sd = 10))

names(dat) <- c("variance = 9",
                "variance = 36",
                "variance = 100")

dat <- melt(dat)
ggplot(dat) +
 aes(x = value, fill = variable) +
 geom_density(alpha=0.25) +
 scale_fill_hue() +
 labs(title = "Normal distributions with different variances", fill = "Distributions", subtitle = "Mean = 100") +
 theme_minimal()
```

As you can see on the second graph, when the variance (or the standard deviation) decreases, the observations are closer to the mean. On the contrary, when the variance (or standard deviation) increases, it is more likely that observations will be further away from the mean.

A random variable $X$ which follows a normal distribution with a mean of 430 and a variance of 17 is denoted $X ~ \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu = 430, \sigma^2 = 17)$.

We have seen that, although different normal distributions have different shapes, all normal distributions have common characteristics:

* They are symmetric, 50% of the population is above the mean and 50% of the population is below the mean
* The mean, median and mode are equal
* The empirical rule detailed earlier is applicable to all normal distributions

# Probabilities and quantiles

Probabilities and quantiles for random variables with normal distributions are easily found using R via the functions `pnorm()` and `qnorm()`. Probabilities associated with a normal distribution can also be found using this <a href="https://antoinesoetewey.shinyapps.io/statistics-101/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shiny app</a>.

Although there are infinitely many normal distributions (since there is a normal distribution for every combination of mean and variance), we need only one table: the **standard normal distribution**. The normal standard distribution is a special case of the normal distribution where the mean is equal to 0 and the variance is equal to 1. A normal random variable $X$ can always be transformed to a standard normal random variable $Z$, a process known as "scaling" or "standardization", by substracting the mean from the observation, and dividing the result by the standard deviation. Formally:

$$Z = \frac{X - \mu}{\sigma}$$

So the mean of the standard normal distribution is 0, and its variance is 1, denoted $Z ~ \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu = 0, \sigma^2 = 1)$. From this formula, we see that $Z$, referred as standard score or $Z$ score, allows to see how far away one specific observation is from the mean of all observations, with the distance expressed in standard deviations. In other words, the $Z$ score corresponds to the number of standard deviations one observation is away from the mean. A positive $Z$ score means that the specific observation is above the mean, whereas a negative $Z$ score means that the specific observation is below the mean. $Z$ scores are often used to compare an individual to her peers.

For instance, suppose a student scoring 60 at a statistics exam with the mean score of the class being 40, and scoring 60 at an economics exam with the mean score of the class being 80 (assume the standard deviations are the same for both exams). Given the "raw" scores, one would say that the student performed as well in statistics as in economics. However, taking into consideration her peers, the student performed relatively better in statistics than in economics. Computing $Z$ scores allows to take into consideration all other students (i.e., the entire distribution) and gives a better measure of comparison.

Furthermore, $Z$ score also enables to compare observations that would otherwise be difficult because they have different units for example. Suppose you want to compare a salary in â‚¬ with a weight in kg. Without standardization, there is no way to conclude whether someone is more extreme in terms of her wage or in terms of her weight. 

## Examples in R and by hand

*Note that there are several ways to arrive at the solution in the following exercises. You may therefore use other steps than the ones presented to obtain the same result.*

### Ex. 1

Let $Z$ denote a normal random variable with mean 0 and standard deviation 1, find $P(Z > 1)$.

We actually look for the shaded area in the following figure:

![Standard normal distribution: $P(Z > 1)$](/blog/do-my-data-follow-a-normal-distribution-a-note-on-the-most-widely-used-distribution-and-how-to-test-for-normality-in-r_files/Screenshot 2020-01-30 at 14.18.54.png){width=100%}

#### In R

```{r}
pnorm(1,
      mean = 0,
      sd = 1, # sd stands for standard deviation
      lower.tail = FALSE)
```

We look for the probability of $Z$ being larger than 1 so we set the argument `lower.tail = FALSE`. The default `lower.tail = TRUE` would give the result for $P(Z < 1)$. Note that $P(Z = 1) = 0$ so writing $P(Z > 1)$ or $P(Z \ge 1)$ is equivalent.

#### By hand

See that the random variable $Z$ has already a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1, so no transformation is required. To find the probabilities by hand, we need to refer to the standard normal distribution table shown below:

![Standard normal distribution table [@wackerly2014mathematical].](/blog/do-my-data-follow-a-normal-distribution-a-note-on-the-most-widely-used-distribution-and-how-to-test-for-normality-in-r_files/Screenshot 2020-01-30 at 15.07.44.png){width=100%}

From the illustration at the top of the table, we see that the values inside the table correspond to the area under the normal curve **above** a certain $z$. Since we are looking precisely at the probability above $z = 1$ (since we look for $P(Z > 1)$), we can simply proceed down the first ($z$) column in the table until $z = 1.0$. The probability is 0.1587. Thus, $P(Z > 1) = 0.1587$. This is similar to what we found using R, except that values in the table are rounded to 4 digits.

### Ex. 2

Let $Z$ denote a normal random variable with mean 0 and standard deviation 1, find $P(âˆ’1 \le Z \le 1)$.

We are looking for the shaded area in the following figure:

![Standard normal distribution: $P(âˆ’1 \le Z \le 1)$](/blog/do-my-data-follow-a-normal-distribution-a-note-on-the-most-widely-used-distribution-and-how-to-test-for-normality-in-r_files/Screenshot 2020-01-30 at 14.19.14.png){width=100%}

#### In R

```{r}
pnorm(1, lower.tail = TRUE) - pnorm(-1, lower.tail = TRUE)
```

Note that the arguments by default for the mean and the standard deviation are `mean = 0` and `sd = 1`. Since this is what we need, we can omit them.^[The argument `lower.tail = TRUE` is also the default so we could omit it as well. However, for clarity and to make sure I compute the propabilities in the correct side of the curve, I used to keep this argument explicit by writing it.]

#### By hand

For this exercise we proceed by steps:

1. The shaded area corresponds to the entire area under the normal curve minus the two white areas in both tails of the curve.
1. We know that the normal distribution is symmetric.
1. Therefore, the shaded area is the entire area under the curve minus two times the white area in the right tail of the curve (the white area in the right tail of the curve being $P(Z > 1)$).
1. We also know that the entire area under the normal curve is 1.
1. Thus, the shaded area is 1 minus 2 times $P(Z > 1)$:

$$P(âˆ’1 \le Z \le 1) = 1 - 2 \cdot P(Z > 1) = 1 - 2 \cdot 0.1587 = 0.6826$$

where $P(Z > 1) = 0.1587$ has been found in the previous exercise.

### Ex. 3

Let $Z$ denote a normal random variable with mean 0 and standard deviation 1, find $P(0 \le Z \le 1.37)$.

We are looking for the shaded area in the following figure:

![Standard normal distribution: $P(0 \le Z \le 1.37)$](/blog/do-my-data-follow-a-normal-distribution-a-note-on-the-most-widely-used-distribution-and-how-to-test-for-normality-in-r_files/Screenshot 2020-01-30 at 14.19.46.png){width=100%}

#### In R

```{r}
pnorm(0, lower.tail = FALSE) - pnorm(1.37, lower.tail = FALSE)
```

#### By hand

Again we proceed by steps for this exercise:

1. We know that $P(Z > 0) = 0.5$ since the entire area under the curve is 1, half of it is 0.5.
1. The shaded area is half of the entire area under the curve minus the area from 1.37 to infinity.
1. The area under the curve from 1.37 to infinity corresponds to $P(Z > 1.37)$.
1. Therefore, the shaded area is $0.5 - P(Z > 1.37)$.
1. To find $P(Z > 1.37)$, proceed down the $z$ column in the table to the entry 1.3 and then across the top of the table to the column labeled .07 to read $P(Z > 1.37) = .0853$
1. Thus,

$$P(0 \le Z \le 1.37) = P(Z > 0) - P(Z > 1.37) = 0.5 - 0.0853 = 0.4147$$

### Ex. 4

Recap the example presented in the empirical rule: Suppose that the scores of an exam in statistics given to all students in a Belgian university are known to have a normal distribution with mean $\mu = 67$ and standard deviation $\sigma = 9$. What fraction of the scores lies between 70 and 80?

We are looking for the shaded area in the following figure:

![$P(70 \le X \le 80)$ where $X \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu = 67, \sigma^2 = 9^2)$](/blog/do-my-data-follow-a-normal-distribution-a-note-on-the-most-widely-used-distribution-and-how-to-test-for-normality-in-r_files/Screenshot 2020-01-30 at 16.24.30.png){width=100%}

#### In R

```{r}
pnorm(70, mean = 67, sd = 9, lower.tail = FALSE) - pnorm(80, mean = 67, sd = 9, lower.tail = FALSE)
```

#### By hand

Remind that we are looking for $P(70 \le X \le 80)$ where $X \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu = 67, \sigma^2 = 9^2)$. The random variable $X$ is in its "raw" format, meaning that it has not been standardized yet since the mean is 67 and the variance is $9^2$. We thus need to first apply the transformation to standardize the endpoints 70 and 80 with the following formula:

$$Z = \frac{X - \mu}{\sigma}$$

After the standardization, $x = 70$ becomes (in terms of $z$, so in terms of deviation from the mean expressed in standard deviation):

$$z = \frac{70 - 67}{9} = 0.3333$$

and $x = 80$ becomes:

$$z = \frac{80 - 67}{9} = 1.4444$$

The figure above in terms of $X$ is now in terms of $Z$:

![$P(0.3333 \le Z \le 1.4444)$ where $Z \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu = 0, \sigma^2 = 1)$](/blog/do-my-data-follow-a-normal-distribution-a-note-on-the-most-widely-used-distribution-and-how-to-test-for-normality-in-r_files/Screenshot 2020-01-30 at 16.37.13.png){width=100%}

Finding the probability $P(0.3333 \le Z \le 1.4444)$ is similar to exercises 1 to 3:

1. The shaded area corresponds to the area under the curve from $z = 0.3333$ to $z = 1.4444$.
1. In other words, the shaded area is the area under the curve from $z = 0.3333$ to infinity minus the area under the curve from $z = 1.4444$ to infinity.
1. From the table, $P(Z > 0.3333) = 0.3707$ and $P(Z > 1.4444) = 0.0749$
1. Thus:

$$P(0.3333 \le Z \le 1.4444) = P(Z > 0.3333) - P(Z > 1.4444) = 0.3707 - 0.0749 = 0.2958$$^[The difference with the probability found in R comes from the rounding.]

To conclude this exercice, we can say that, given that the mean scores is 67 and the standard deviation is 9, 29.58% of the students scored between 70 and 80.
