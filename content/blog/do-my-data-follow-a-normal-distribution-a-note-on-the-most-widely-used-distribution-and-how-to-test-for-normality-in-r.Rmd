# Introduction

Many natural phenomena in real life can be approximated by a bell-shaped frequency distribution known as a normal distribution or the Gaussian distribution.

# Empirical rule

Data possessing an approximately normal distribution have a definite variation, as expressed by the following empirical rule:

* $\mu \pm \sigma$ includes approximately 68% of the observations
* $\mu \pm 2 \cdot \sigma$ includes approximately 95% of the observations
* $\mu \pm 3 \cdot \sigma$ includes almost all of the observations (99.7% to be more precise)

where $\mu$ and $\sigma$ correspond to the population mean and population standard deviation, respectively.

The empirical rule is illustred by the following 2 examples. Suppose that the scores of an exam in statistics given to all students in a Belgian university are known to have, approximately, a normal distribution with mean $\mu = 67$ and standard deviation $\sigma = 9$. It can then be deduced that approximately 68% of the scores are between 58 and 76, that approximately 95% of the scores are between 49 and 85, and that almost all of the scores (99.7%) are between 40 and 94. Thus, knowing the mean and the standard deviation gives us a fairly good picture of the distribution of scores. Now suppose that a single university student is randomly selected from those who took the exam. What is the probability that her score will be between 49 and 85? Based on the empirical rule, we find that 0.95 is a reasonable answer to this probability question.

The utility and value of the empirical rule are due to the common occurrence of approximately normal distributions of measurements in nature. For example, IQ, shoe size, height, birth weight, etc. are approximately normally-distributed. You will find that approximately 95% of these measurements will be within $2\sigma$ of their mean [@wackerly2014mathematical].

# Parameters

The normal distribution has two parameters: (i) the mean $\mu$ and (ii) the variance $\sigma^2$ (the square of the standard deviation $\sigma$). The mean $\mu$ locates the center of the distribution and the variance $\sigma^2$ measures its spread.

The mean $\mu$ can take on any finite value, whereas the variance $\sigma^2$ can assume any positive finite value (i.e., $\sigma^2 > 0$).

# Characteristics

A normal distribution is mount-shaped, unimodal and symmetric around the mean.

# Probabilities and quantiles

Probabilities and quantiles for random variables with normal distributions are easily found using R via the functions `pnorm()` and `qnorm()`. Probabilities associated with a normal distribution can also be found using this <a href="https://antoinesoetewey.shinyapps.io/statistics-101/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shiny app</a> (select the normal distribution).

Although there are infinitely many normal distributions (since there is a normal distribution for every mean and variance), we need only one table: the **standard normal distribution**. A normal random variable $X$ can always be transformed to a standard normal random variable $Z$ by using the formula:

$$Z = \frac{X - \mu}{\sigma}$$

Thanks for reading. I hope the article helped you to learn more about the normal distribution and how to test for normality in R. See other articles in [statistics](/tag/statistics).
