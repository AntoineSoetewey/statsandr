# Introduction

Although I have been using RStudio for several years, I only recently discovered RStudio addins. Since then, I am using these addins almost every time I open RStudio.

What are RStudio addins? RStudio addins are extensions which provide a simple mechanism for executing advanced R functions from within RStudio. In simpler words, when executing an addin (by clicking a button in the Addins menu), the corresponding code is directly sent to the console and executed without you having to write the code. If it is still not clear, remember that for importing a dataset in RStudio, you have two options:

* import it by writing code (thanks to the `read.csv()` function for instance)
* or you can import it by clicking on the "Import Dataset" button in the Environment pane and follow the steps until your dataset is executed in the console and thus your dataset imported

A RStudio addin is exactly like the Import Dataset button but for other common functionalities. So you could write code as you can import a dataset by writing code, but thanks to RStudio addins you can execute code without actually writing the necessary code. By using the RStudio addins, RStudio will run the required code for you. RStudio addins can be as simple as a function that inserts a commonly used snippet of code, and as complex as a Shiny application that accepts input from the user to draw a plot. RStudio addins have the advantage that they allow you to execute complex and advanced code much more easily than if you would have to write it yourself.

# Addins

If you are still not convinced, see below a list of the addins I find most useful together with concrete examples. I believe addins are worth trying for all R users. Beginners will have the possibility to use functions that they would not have used otherwise because the code is too complex, whereas advanced users may find them useful to speed up the writing of their code in some circumstances. For other tips in R, see the article "[Tips and tricks in RStudio and R Markdown](/blog/tips-and-tricks-in-rstudio-and-r-markdown/)". Note that the list below is not exhaustive and you are likely to find others useful too depending on what type of analyses you do on RStudio. Feel free to comment at the end of the article to let me know (and other readers) other addins you found worth using.

## Esquisse

Esquisse is an addin developed by a French company called dreamRs. Here is how they define it:

> This addin allows you to interactively explore your data by visualizing it with the ggplot2 package. It allows you to draw bar plots, curves, scatter plots, histograms, boxplot and sf objects, then export the graph or retrieve the code to reproduce the graph.

With this addin you can easily create beautiful graphs from the `{ggplot2}` package and the best part according to me is that you can retrieve the code to reproduce the graph. Compared to the default `{graphics}` package, it is true that graphs from the `{ggplot2}` package look usually better but the code is also longer and more complex. With this addin, you can draw graphs from the `{ggplot2}` package by dragging and dropping variables of interest in an user-friendly and interactive window, and then use the generated code in your script.

For the sake of illustration, let's say wee want to create a scatter plot of the variables `Sepal.Length` and `Petal.Length` of the dataset `iris` and color the points by the variable `Species`. For this, follow these steps:

1. load the dataset:

```{r}
dat <- iris
```

2. install the package `{esquisse}`. This must be done only once

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("esquisse")
```

3. open the 'ggplot2' builder from the RStudio Addins menu:

RStudio Addins are distributed as R packages. Once you've installed an R package that contains addins, they'll be immediately become available within RStudio.

Thanks for reading. I hope that you will find these addins useful for your future R-related projects. See other articles related to R [here](/tags/r/).
