<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p><em>This is a joint work with Prof. <a href="https://twitter.com/NikoSpeybroeck" target="_blank">Niko Speybroeck</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/arosas_aguirre" target="_blank">Angel Rosas-Aguirre</a>.</em></p>
<p>Belgium recently started to lift its lockdown measures initially imposed to contain the spread of the Covid-19. Following this decision taken by Belgian authorities, we analyze how the situation evolved so far.</p>
<p>Contrarily to a previous article in which I analyzed the outbreak of the <a href="/blog/covid-19-in-belgium/">Coronavirus in Belgium using the SIR model</a>, in this article we focus on the evolution of:</p>
<ul>
<li>the number of hospital admissions (per 100,000 inhabitants)</li>
<li>the number of new confirmed cases (also per 100,000 inhabitants)</li>
</ul>
<p>at the province and national level.</p>
<p>Data is from <a href="https://epistat.wiv-isp.be/covid/" target="_blank">Sciensano</a>.</p>

<p>From the above figure, we see that the rate of hospitalizations continue with a decreasing trend in all provinces (and in Belgium as well).</p>

<p><em>Note that the reported number of new confirmed cases is probably underestimated, so this figure should be interpreted with extreme caution.</em></p>

<p>Thanks for reading. We hope that these figures will keep evolving in the right direction. In the meantime, take care and stay safe!</p>
