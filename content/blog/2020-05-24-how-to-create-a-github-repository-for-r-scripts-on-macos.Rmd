# Introduction

Few days ago, a colleague asked me how to upload some R code on GitHub in order to make it accessible to everyone. Due to the lockdown, I could not just go into his office and show him on his computer. So I sent him several screenshots showing him, step by step, how to do so.

Right before I deleted the screenshots I'd just taken, I thought that perhaps they would be useful for other persons, so I wrote this article.

*Note 1: The screenshots have been taken on MacOS and I have not tested it on Windows. Do not hesitate to let me know in the comments whether it is similar or not on other operating systems.*

*Note 2: There must be other ways to do it, but the method shown below is easy and works well.*

# Prerequisite

In order to upload your R code on GitHub, you will need at least:

* a [GitHub](https://github.com/){target="_blank"} account
* the [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/){target="_blank"} application installed on your computer

# Step-by-step guide

For this guide, I use a R script created to plot the [evolution of the hospital admissions due to COVID-19 in Belgium](/blog/covid-19-in-belgium-is-it-over-yet/). See the [repository on GitHub](https://github.com/AntoineSoetewey/COVID-19-Figures){target="_blank"} in case you want to see the final result before proceeding further.

So here is without further ado how to upload your R script on GitHub in images:

![Step 1: Go to github.com/login and sign in](/blog/2020-05-24-how-to-create-a-github-repository-for-r-scripts-on-macos_files/upload-r-code-on-GitHub-example-with-an-r-script-on-mac-os-1.png)

![Step 2: Go to your GitHub profile and create a new repository](/blog/2020-05-24-how-to-create-a-github-repository-for-r-scripts-on-macos_files/upload-r-code-on-GitHub-example-with-an-r-script-on-mac-os-2.png)

Your R code is now available via the new repository on your GitHub profile.

# Additional notes

If you need to edit your code:

![Step 14: Locate the folder of the repo on your computer, open the R script, edit it and save it](/blog/2020-05-24-how-to-create-a-github-repository-for-r-scripts-on-macos_files/upload-r-code-on-GitHub-example-with-an-r-script-on-mac-os-17.png)

After your script is saved, **do not forget to commit the changes and push the commit**.

In case you need to see an old version of your code, you can see all commits here:
