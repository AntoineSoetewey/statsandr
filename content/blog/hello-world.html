<p>This is the first post for the blog <a href="/">Stats and R</a>, just to introduce it. This blog aims at helping academics and professionals working with data to grasp important concepts in <a href="/tags/statistics/">statistics</a> and to <a href="/tags/r/">apply them in R</a>.</p>
<p>The goal of this website is to make statistics easy to understand by illustrating with examples and using plain English. When possible, for all statistical concepts covered here, I also write an article on how to apply these concepts in R.</p>
<p>If you are new to this blog and to R, I invite you to start with the following articles:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/blog/how-to-install-r-and-rstudio/">How to install R and RStudio</a></li>
<li><a href="/blog/how-to-import-an-excel-file-in-rstudio/">How to import an Excel file in RStudio</a></li>
<li><a href="/blog/descriptive-statistics-by-hand/">Descriptive statistics by hand</a> or <a href="/blog/descriptive-statistics-in-r/">in R</a></li>
</ul>
