<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>In this article, I show how to create a timeline of your CV in R. A CV timeline illustrates key information about your education, work experiences and extra activities. The main advantage of CV timelines compared to regular CV is that they make you stand out immediately by being visually appealing and easier to scan. It also allows you to better present your “story” by showing the chronology of your jobs and activities and thus explain how you got to where you are today. (It can also be part of your portfolio to show your R skills.)</p>
<p>We show below how to create such CV in R with a minimal reproducible example. Feel free to use the code and adapt it to you. For a more complete example (together with the code) you can check my own CV timeline <a href="https://www.antoinesoetewey.com/files/CV_timeline_antoinesoetewey.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>

<h1>How to personalize it</h1>
<p>If you want to edit the example with your own academic, extra and work experiences you basically just have to edit the dataframe called <code>cv</code> in the code above. Each row of the dataset <code>cv</code> is a different academic program, job or activity. Rows should include:</p>
<ul>
<li>the name of the academic program, job title or activity</li>
<li>the name of the university, school, company or workplace</li>
<li>the category: academic, work experience or extra</li>
<li>the starting date (dates must be in format <code>yyyy-mm-dd</code>)</li>
<li>the ending date. If the role has not yet ended, type <code>today</code> instead of the date. By using <code>today</code> your CV timeline will automatically adapt to today’s date</li>
</ul>
<p>Add or remove a row in the dataframe if you want to add or remove a role. Indicate <code>NA</code> if you do not want to specify any workplace (as it has been done for <code>Extra3</code>). Last, do not forget to replace my name with yours for the subtitle of the timeline at the end of the code.</p>
<p>Experienced R users may wish to edit the <code>plot_timeline2</code> function to their needs. However, if you are happy with the template and design of the example, you only have to change things mentioned above.</p>
</div>
<div id="additional-note" class="section level1">
<h1>Additional note</h1>
<p>Instead of editing the code according to your roles directly in the script, you can also create an Excel file with the required data (job title, workplace, type, start date, end date) and then <a href="/blog/how-to-import-an-excel-file-in-rstudio/">import it into R</a>. Editing the Excel file is easier and less prone to coding errors. Moreover, if you have a long career, the code becomes long while if you import the Excel file, it will always stay two lines of code.</p>
