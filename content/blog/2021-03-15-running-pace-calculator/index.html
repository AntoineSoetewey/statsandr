<div id="introduction" class="section level1">
<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>If you are a runner yourself, you are certainly aware of how important preparation is before a race. For the preparation of my first <a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/1928117850/overview" target="_blank">marathon</a>, I used to rely on a training plan.</p>
<p>This running plan was great, but an important information was missing: the running pace. Most of the time, the distance and the time was given, but I needed to figure out the pace myself.</p>
<p>Although the computation is fairly easy, I felt like I was missing a quick way to compute my running pace based on the distance and expected time given by the training plan. So I started to look for a solution online, but I was never completely satisfied. Some running pace calculators were too detailed (showing way too much information) others were too basic (showing not enough information).</p>
</div>
<div id="running-pace-calculator" class="section level1">
<h1>Running pace calculator</h1>
<p>I thus decided to create one myself so I could really choose what information would be displayed, and how it would be displayed.</p>
<p>For the runners among you, here is a link to the application:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://antoinesoetewey.shinyapps.io/running-pace-calculator/" target="_blank"><strong>Running pace calculator</strong></a></li>
</ul>
<p>If you follow the blog, you know how much I like R Shiny, so you probably guessed that the calculator is built with this technology.</p>
<p>Note that this running pace calculator is inspired by several calculators I found online. I kept it quite basic so that it goes straight to the point, but most importantly so that it would fit to my needs (which may be different than yours).</p>
</div>
<div id="how-to-use-it" class="section level1">
<h1>How to use it?</h1>
<p>I try to keep all my <a href="/tags/shiny/">Shiny apps</a> easy to use for everyone. However, here is how to use it in case it is not intuitive enough:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Access the app via this <a href="https://antoinesoetewey.shinyapps.io/running-pace-calculator/" target="_blank">link</a></li>
<li>Choose the units (kilometers or miles)</li>
<li>Enter the distance you plan to run</li>
<li>Enter the time for which you would like to run that distance</li>
</ol>
<p>On the right panel (or bottom if you use the app on mobile) you will see:</p>
<ul>
<li>The pace you will need to respect in order to run the distance within the time you specified</li>
<li>Depending on the units you selected, your pace will be displayed in minutes/km or minutes/miles, and kilometers/hour or miles/hour</li>
<li>The table below displays the splitsâ€”the time at each kilometer or mile</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="code" class="section level1">
<h1>Code</h1>
<p>As for all my <a href="/tags/shiny/">Shiny apps</a>, the code is available on <a href="https://github.com/AntoineSoetewey/running-pace-calculator" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. Feel free to open an issue if you find a bug or if you have a suggestion. And if you are proficient in R Shiny, do not hesitate to propose a pull request with your suggestions implemented.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading. I hope this <a href="https://antoinesoetewey.shinyapps.io/running-pace-calculator/" target="_blank">running pace calculator</a> will be useful if you are a runner, or if you plan to start running.</p>
<p>As always, if you have a question about the app, please add it as a comment so other readers can benefit from the discussion.</p>
