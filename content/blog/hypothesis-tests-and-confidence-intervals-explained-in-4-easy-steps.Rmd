Inferential statistics includes two important tools: hypothesis tests and confidence intervals.
These tools can be used for many parameters. In this article we focus on the 6 most xxx

As part of my teaching assistant position, I quickly realized that students often struggle to compute confidence intervals, perform hypothesis tests and interpret the results. This article tries to xxx to continue.


Thanks for reading. I hope this article helped you to understand better how to perform hypothesis tests and construct confidence intervals by hand.
