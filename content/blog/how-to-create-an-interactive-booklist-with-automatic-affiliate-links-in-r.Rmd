# Introduction

Booklists are a useful way to share the books you have read and which you recommend to other readers and/or to promote the books you have written. It can be as simple as a list of book titles displayed on your personal website or blog. You may however wish to present this list of books in a more sophisticated way, such as in a table with titles, authors and links to buy it for instance. In this blog post I show you how to create an interactive booklist with automatic Amazon affiliate links in R. By interactive, I mean a booklist which allows users to search for books by title or author. Moreover, by automatic Amazon affiliate links, I mean URLs (with your affiliate link of course) that redirect directly to the book in question on the Amazon webstore, without manually creating a link for each book. This technique is especially helpful for those of you who have hundreds of books in their list as you will need to create the URL only once and it will adapt automatically to all books. If this is not clear, see a <a href="https://www.antoinesoetewey.com/files/booklist.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">live example here</a>.

# Requirements

In order to build this augmented booklist with your affiliate link, you need:

* an Amazon associates account. Register <a href="https://affiliate-program.amazon.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a> if you do not have an account yet
* a list of books (which you recommend and/or written by you)

# Create a booklist

You have two options:

1. create it in Excel then import it into R
1. create it directly in R

## Create it in Excel then import it

The easiest way is to follow these steps:

1. open an Excel file and fill it in with two columns: (i) one with the titles and (ii) a second with the authors (see figure below)
1. save it in a .csv format (in Excel, File > Save As... > choose the CSV file format and save it)
1. import it into R (see [how to import a .csv file](/blog/how-to-import-an-excel-file-in-rstudio/) if you struggle with the importation)
1. (if you need to edit the list in the future, edit it directly in the .csv file and not in the Excel file)

Here is how you booklist created in Excel should look like (with I suppose more books in yours):

![Step 1: Booklist created in Excel](/blog/how-to-create-an-interactive-booklist-with-automatic-affiliate-links-in-r_files/booklist-csv.png)

We now import it into RStudio and rename the dataset as `dat` (see [here](/blog/how-to-import-an-excel-file-in-rstudio/#user-friendly-way) why I always use a generic name instead of more specific names):

```{r, eval = FALSE}
dat <- read.csv("booklist.csv", # name of your file with .csv extension
                header = TRUE, # names of variables are present
                sep = ",") # values are separated by a comma
```

You can always check that your booklist is correctly imported by running `head(name_of_dataset)` or `View(name_of_dataset)`.

## Create it directly in R

You can create your booklist directly in R with the command `data.frame()`:

```{r}
# Create the data frame named dat
dat <- data.frame(
  "Title" = c("A Random Walk Down Wall Street",
              "Naked Statistics",
              "Freakonomics"),
  "Author" = c("Burton G. Malkiel",
               "Charles Wheelan",
               "Steven D. Levitt and Stephen J. Dubner"),
  stringsAsFactors = FALSE
)
# Print the data frame
dat
```

# Make it interactive

In order to be able to search for books by author or title, we use the `datatable()` command from the DT package. Below the table with the default options:

```{r}
library(DT)
datatable(dat)
```

Let's improve this table by:

* removing row numbers
* adding a filter on top of "Title" and "Author" columns
* adding the possibility to copy or download the table
* show only first 5 entries instead of 10
* order books by title in ascending order

```{r}
datatable(dat,
  rownames = FALSE, # remove row numbers
  filter = "top", # add filter on top of columns
  extensions = "Buttons", # add download buttons
  options = list(
    autoWidth = TRUE,
    dom = "Blfrtip", # location of the download buttons
    buttons = c("copy", "csv", "excel", "pdf", "print"), # download buttons
    pageLength = 5, # show first 5 entries, default is 10
    order = list(0, "asc") # order the title column by ascending order
  )
)
```

# Add URLs with your affiliate link to the table

We are now going to add URLs (with your affiliate link) which depend on the title of the book in the interactive table presented above. For this, we first need to extract the affiliate link which will serve as the base of the URL, then add the title of the book at then end of the URL. The fact that we add the title of the book at the end of the URL makes it automatic. Indeed, the final URL will redirect to the search page of the book (thanks to the title of the book as keywords) and with your affiliate link included (as we use the affiliate link as the base URL).

## Extract affiliate link

To extract the affiliate link, follow these steps (see figures below for help):

1. Go to your Amazon associates account
1. Click on Product Linking > Link to Any Page
1. Click on the tab "Link to Search Results"
1. Choose "Books & Textbooks" for the product line
1. Enter any keywords you want and a name for it (the two will be change later so it does not matter what you type)
1. Click on the button "Get HTML"
1. Copy in your clipboard (CTRL+c on Windows or cmd+c on Mac) the code displayed in the Preview (right pane)

![Step 2: Link to Any Page on Amazon associates account](/blog/how-to-create-an-interactive-booklist-with-automatic-affiliate-links-in-r_files/get-amazon-affiliate-link.png)

![Step 3 to 7: Create Amazon affiliate link for a search page](/blog/how-to-create-an-interactive-booklist-with-automatic-affiliate-links-in-r_files/create-amazon-affiliate-link.png)

The code you just copied should look like this (not exactly the same though as it includes your personal affiliate link):

`<a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/search?ie=UTF8&tag=antoinesoetew-20&linkCode=ur2&linkId=a587bdd780cbbfb6d3f4569f7fb358fc&camp=1789&creative=9325&index=books&keywords=BOOK TITLE">BOOK TITLE</a><img src="//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=antoinesoetew-20&l=ur2&o=1" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />`

From this long code, remove everything which follows `keywords=` but keep `keywords=` (that is why it does not matter what you typed in step 5 above). Following our example, we are left with this piece of code:

`<a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/search?ie=UTF8&tag=antoinesoetew-20&linkCode=ur2&linkId=a587bdd780cbbfb6d3f4569f7fb358fc&camp=1789&creative=9325&index=books&keywords=`

Copy this shortened code.

## Append the book title to make it automatic

We are now going to concatenate (i.e., append several character strings together) the Amazon affiliate link (the code we just copied), the title of the book and then a closing HTML tag with the `paste0()` command. The result will be a URL which takes the affiliate link as the base and the title of the book as keywords, making it automatic and adapted for every book in your booklist. To do this, run the following command in R:

```{r}
# Do not mix " and ', they are different in this case!
link <- paste0('<a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/search?ie=UTF8&tag=antoinesoetew-20&linkCode=ur2&linkId=a587bdd780cbbfb6d3f4569f7fb358fc&camp=1789&creative=9325&index=books&keywords=', # affiliate link
                         dat$Title, # book title
                         '">Amazon</a>') # closing HTML tag
```

Your affiliate links should look something like this, with same affiliate links and closing tags but with different keywords, corresponding to book titles:

```{r}
head(link)
```

## Add links to the interactive table

Now that the URLs are specific to each book, we can add them to the interactive table build earlier:

```{r}
dat$Link <- link
```

Finally, we can display the interactive table with titles, authors and their URLs:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
datatable(dat,
  rownames = FALSE, # remove row numbers
  filter = "top", # add filter on top of columns
  extensions = "Buttons", # add download buttons
  options = list(
    autoWidth = TRUE,
    dom = "Blfrtip", # location of the download buttons
    buttons = c("copy", "csv", "excel", "pdf", "print"), # download buttons
    pageLength = 5, # show first 5 entries, default is 10
    order = list(0, "asc") # order the title column by ascending order
  ),
  escape = FALSE # to make URLs clickable 
)
```

This is exactly the same code than before except that we need to add `escape = FALSE` to make URLs clickable.

# Final result

```{r, echo = FALSE}
datatable(dat,
  rownames = FALSE, # remove row numbers
  filter = "top", # add filter on top of columns
  extensions = "Buttons", # add download buttons
  options = list(
    autoWidth = TRUE,
    dom = "Blfrtip", # location of the download buttons
    buttons = c("copy", "csv", "excel", "pdf", "print"), # download buttons
    pageLength = 5, # show first 5 entries, default is 10
    order = list(0, "asc") # order the title column by ascending order
  ),
  escape = FALSE # to make URLs clickable 
)
```

Check that everything works properly by clicking on different links. If you did not miss any steps, it should redirect you to the Amazon store with the title of the book in the search bar and thus the book in question appearing in the search results.

Thanks for reading. I hope this article helped you to build an interactive booklist with an automated affiliate link to each of the books in your list.
