I am happy to announce that our paper entitled "Right to be forgotten for mortgage insurance issued to cancer survivors: critical assessment and new proposal" has been accepted for publication in *European Actuarial Journal*.

In this paper, we propose an alternative method to determine the waiting period opening the right to be forgotten in insurance. This new method is based on a constraint imposed to the premium, which is then transposed into a target on the conditional observed survival. Furthermore, the paper also investigates the impact of the stage of the tumor at diagnosis on waiting periods.
