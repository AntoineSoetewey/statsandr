![Word cloud in a Shiny app](/blog/draw-a-word-cloud-thanks-to-a-shiny-app_files/Screenshot 2020-02-04 at 11.03.29.png){width=100%}

Below a Shiny app to help you draw a word cloud:

* [Word cloud](https://antoinesoetewey.shinyapps.io/word-cloud/)

Word clouds are particularly useful as part of text mining analyses. Moreover, it is also useful to analyze string and character variables for any datasets (see the [different data types in R](/blog/data-types-in-r/)).

*Note that the link may not work if the app has hit the monthly usage limit. Try again later if that is the case.*

# How to use this app?

* In **Word source** you can see two examples of word clouds with preloaded texts. If you want to use your own file, choose the option "Upload a file"
* When uploading a file, make sure to upload a .csv or .txt file
* If it is a .csv file, there should be only one column containing all words or sentences (see example files: [example.csv](https://www.antoinesoetewey.com/files/ihaveadream.csv) and [example.txt](https://www.antoinesoetewey.com/files/ihaveadream.txt))
* Choose the language of the text. Stop words in the chosen language will be automatically removed
* Numbers and punctuations will be automatically removed as well, regardless of the language
* You can remove specific words by specifying them after having clicked on "Remove specific words?". Indicate one word per line
* Change the default options in **Maximum number of words** and **Background color** if needed
* If you need to display this word cloud in your analyses, you can simply take a screenshot and include it in your document

Thznks for reading. I hope you will find this app useful to draw word clouds of your texts.
