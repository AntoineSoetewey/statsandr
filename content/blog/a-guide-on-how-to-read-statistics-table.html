<p class="caption">Shiny app to compute probabilities for the main probability distributions</p>
</div>
<p>Below a Shiny app to help you read the main statistical tables:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://antoinesoetewey.shinyapps.io/statistics-101/" target="_blank">Statistics-101</a></li>
</ul>
<p>This Shiny app helps you to compute probabilities for the main probability distributions.</p>
<p>Here is the entire code (or see the last version on <a href="https://github.com/AntoineSoetewey/statistics-101" target="_blank">GitHub</a>) in case you would like to enhance it. See an example on how to use this app after the embedded code.</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/AntoineSoetewey/b0cbddf52fc42afe379551536f223fb7.js"></script>
<p><em>Note that the link may not work if the app has hit the monthly usage limit. Try again later if that is the case.</em></p>

<h1>How to use this app?</h1>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Open the app via this <a href="https://antoinesoetewey.shinyapps.io/statistics-101/" target="_blank">link</a></li>
<li>Choose the distribution</li>
<li>Set the parameter(s) of the distribution (the parameters depend of course on the chosen distribution)</li>
<li>Select whether you want to find the lower tail, upper tail or an interval</li>
<li>Choose the value of x</li>
</ol>
<p>On the right panel (or below depending on the size of your screen) you will see:</p>
<ul>
<li>a recap of the data you just entered</li>
<li>the numerical solution (i.e., the probability)</li>
<li>a visualization of the solution</li>
<li>the probability density function together with the mean, the standard deviation and the variance</li>
</ul>

<h1>Example</h1>
<p>Here is an example with the most common distribution: the <strong>normal distribution</strong>.</p>
<p>Imagine the following problem: The cost of weekly maintenance and repair of a business has been observed over a long period of time and turns out to be distributed according to a normal distribution with an average of 402€ and a standard deviation of 22€. Having set a budget of 439€ for next week, what is the probability that the cost exceeds this budget?</p>
<p>To solve this problem, follow these steps in the app:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Choose the normal distribution, as it is said that the costs follow a normal distribution</li>
<li>Set the mean <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> equal to 402, as it is said that the average cost is 402€</li>
<li>In the statement, the standard deviation is given (and not the variance) so select “Standard deviation <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span>” and set it equal to 22</li>
<li>We are asked what is the probability the the cost <strong>exceeds</strong> the budget. Therefore, we look for the probability <strong>above</strong> a certain x, so select upper tail <span class="math inline">\(P(X &gt; x)\)</span></li>
<li>We are now asked to find the probability that the cost exceeds 439€, so set x equal to 439</li>
</ol>
<p>The solution panel gives a recap of the data:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[X ∼ \mathcal{N}(\mu = 402, \sigma^2 = 484)\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(484 = 22^2\)</span>, and the solution: <span class="math display">\[P(X &gt; 439) = P(Z &gt; 1.68) = 0.0463\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(Z = \frac{X - \mu}{\sigma} = \frac{439 - 402}{22} = 1.68\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Z ∼ \mathcal{N}(\mu = 0, \sigma^2 = 1)\)</span> (known as the standard normal distribution). Thus, the probability that the cost next week exceeds the budget of 439€ is 0.0463, or 4.63%.</p>
<p>It also shows the normal distribution (with <span class="math inline">\(\mu = 402\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^2 = 484\)</span>) with the shaded area corresponding to the probability we are looking for. It then gives some details about the density function, the mean, the standard deviation and the variance.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading. I hope you will find this app useful to compute probabilities for the main distributions.</p>
