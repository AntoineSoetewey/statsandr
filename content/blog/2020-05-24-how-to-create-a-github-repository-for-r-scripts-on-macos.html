<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Few days ago, a colleague asked me how to upload some R code on GitHub in order to make it accessible to everyone. Due to the lockdown, I could not just go into his office and show him on his computer. So I sent him several screenshots showing him, step by step, how to do so.</p>
<p>Right before I deleted the screenshots Iâ€™d just taken, I thought that perhaps they would be useful for other persons, so I wrote this article.</p>
<p><em>Note 1: The screenshots have been taken on MacOS and I have not tested it on Windows. Do not hesitate to let me know in the comments whether it is similar or not on other operating systems.</em></p>
<p><em>Note 2: There must be other ways to do it, but the method shown below is easy and works well.</em></p>
</div>
<div id="prerequisite" class="section level1">
<h1>Prerequisite</h1>
<p>In order to upload your R code on GitHub, you will need at least:</p>
<ul>
<li>a <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub</a> account</li>
<li>the <a href="https://desktop.github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub Desktop</a> application installed on your computer</li>
</ul>

<div id="step-by-step-guide" class="section level1">
<h1>Step-by-step guide</h1>
<p>For this guide, I use a R script created to plot the <a href="/blog/covid-19-in-belgium-is-it-over-yet/">evolution of the hospital admissions due to COVID-19 in Belgium</a>. See the <a href="https://github.com/AntoineSoetewey/COVID-19-Figures" target="_blank">repository on GitHub</a> in case you want to see the final result before proceeding further.</p>
<p>You often hear</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A picture is worth a thousand words</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So here is without further ado how to upload your R script on GitHub in images:</p>
