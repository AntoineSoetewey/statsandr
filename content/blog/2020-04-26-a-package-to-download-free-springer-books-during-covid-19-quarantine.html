<div id="introduction" class="section level1">
<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>You probably already have seen that Springer released about <a href="https://link.springer.com/search?facet-content-type=%22Book%22&amp;package=mat-covid19_textbooks&amp;%23038;facet-language=%22En%22&amp;%23038;sortOrder=newestFirst&amp;%23038;showAll=true" target="_blank">500 books</a> for free following the COVID-19 pandemic. According to Springer, these textbooks will be available free of charge until at least the end of July.</p>
<p>Following this announcement, I already downloaded a couple of statistics and R programming textbooks from their website and I will probably download a few more in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>In this article, I present a package that saved me a lot of time and which may be of interest to many of us: the <a href="https://github.com/renanxcortes/springerQuarantineBooksR" target="_blank"><code>{springerQuarantineBooksR}</code> package</a>, developed by <a href="http://renanxcortes.github.io/" target="_blank">Renan Xavier Cortes</a>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>This package allows you to easily download all (or a selection of) Springer books made available free of charge during the COVID-19 quarantine.</p>
<p>With this large collection of high quality resources and my collection of <a href="/blog/top-r-resources-on-covid-19-coronavirus/">top R resources about the Coronavirus</a>, we do not have any excuse to not read and learn during this quarantine.</p>
<p>Without further ado, here is how the package works in practice.</p>
</div>
<div id="installation" class="section level1">
<h1>Installation</h1>
<p>After having installed the <code>{devtools}</code> package, you can install the <code>{springerQuarantineBooksR}</code> package from GitHub with:</p>
<pre class="r"><code># install.packages(&quot;devtools&quot;)
devtools::install_github(&quot;renanxcortes/springerQuarantineBooksR&quot;, force = TRUE)
library(springerQuarantineBooksR)</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="download-all-books-at-once" class="section level1">
<h1>Download all books at once</h1>
<p>First, set the path where you would like to save all books with the <code>setwd()</code> function then download all of them at once with the <code>download_springer_book_files()</code> function. Note it takes several minutes since all books combined amount for almost 8GB.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>setwd(&quot;path_of_your_choice&quot;) # where you want to save the books
download_springer_book_files()</code></pre>
<p>You will find all downloaded books (in PDF format) in a folder named “springer_quarantine_books”, organized by category.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div id="create-a-table-of-springer-books" class="section level1">
<h1>Create a table of Springer books</h1>
<p>You can load into an R session a table containing all the titles made available by Springer, with the <code>download_springer_table()</code> function:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>springer_table &lt;- download_springer_table()</code></pre>
<p>This table can then be improved with the <code>{DT}</code> package to:</p>
<ul>
<li>allow searching a book by its title or author</li>
<li>allow downloading the list of available books, and</li>
<li>make the Springer links clickable for instance</li>
</ul>
<pre class="r"><code># install.packages(&quot;DT&quot;)
library(DT)

springer_table$open_url &lt;- paste0(
  &#39;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;&#39;, # opening HTML tag
  springer_table$open_url, # href link
  &#39;&quot;&gt;SpringerLink&lt;/a&gt;&#39; # closing HTML tag
)

datatable(springer_table,
  rownames = FALSE, # remove row numbers
  filter = &quot;top&quot;, # add filter on top of columns
  extensions = &quot;Buttons&quot;, # add download buttons
  options = list(
    autoWidth = TRUE,
    dom = &quot;Blfrtip&quot;, # location of the download buttons
    buttons = c(&quot;copy&quot;, &quot;csv&quot;, &quot;excel&quot;, &quot;pdf&quot;, &quot;print&quot;), # download buttons
    pageLength = 5, # show first 5 entries, default is 10
    order = list(0, &quot;asc&quot;) # order the title column by ascending order
  ),
  escape = FALSE # make URLs clickable
)</code></pre>
