If you have the chance to work with an experienced programmer, you may be amazed by how fast she can write code. In this article, I share some tips and shortcuts you can use in RStudio and R Markdown to speed up the writing of your code.
<!-- These tricks are divided according to whether they may be used in R Markdown or in RStudio. -->
<!-- I ordered these tricks in the order I find them more useful, your order may be different depending on your usage of course. -->

# Run code in R

You most probably already know this shortcut. 

## Ordered list in R Markdown

In R Markdown, when creating an ordered list such as this one:

1. Item 1
1. Item 2
1. Item 3

Instead of bothering with the numbers and typing

```
1. Item 1
2. Item 2
3. Item 3
```

you can simply type

```
1. Item 1
1. Item 2
1. Item 3
```

for the exact same result (try it yourself or check the code of this article!). This way you do not need to bother which number is next when creating a new item.

To go feven further, any numeric will actually render the same result as long as the first item is the number you want to start from. For example, you could type:

```
1. Item 1
7. Item 2
3. Item 3
```

which renders

1. Item 1
7. Item 2
3. Item 3

However, I suggest always using the number you want to start from for all items because if you move one item at the top, the list will start with this new number. For instance, if we move `7. Item 2` from the previous list at the top, it becomes:

```
7. Item 2
1. Item 1
3. Item 3
```

which incorrectly renders

7. Item 2
1. Item 1
3. Item 3

# New code chunk in R Markdown

When editing R Markdown documents, you will need to insert a new R code chunk many times. The following shortcuts will make your life easier:

```
command + option + I on Mac
CTRL + ALT + I on Windows
```

# Knit a R Markdown document

You can knit R Markdown documents by using these shortcuts:

```
command + shift + K on Mac
CTRL + SHIFT + K on Windows
```

# Others

Similar to many other programs, you can also use:

* `command + shift + N` on Mac and `CTRL + SHIFT + N` on Windows to open a new R Script
* `command + S` on Mac and `CTRL + S` on Windows to save your current script or R Markdown document
