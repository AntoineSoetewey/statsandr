I am happy to announce that a paper I contributed to has been accepted for publication in Open Forum Infectious Diseases [@truong2023childhood].

This study investigates bacterial meningitis among children aged under five years in Southern Vietnam for the last 10 years.

**Read more [here](https://doi.org/10.1093/ofid/ofad229).**

I hope this paper will, to some extent, be helpful for your research.
