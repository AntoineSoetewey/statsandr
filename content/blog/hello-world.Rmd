This is the first post for the blog [Stats and R](/), just to introduce it. This blog aims at helping academics and professionals working with data to grasp important concepts in [statistics](/tags/statistics/) and to [apply them in R](/tags/r/).

The goal of this website is to make statistics easy to understand by illustrating with examples and using plain English. When possible, for all statistical concepts covered here, I also write an article on how to apply these concepts in R.

If you are new to this blog and to R, I invite you to start with the following articles:

* [How to install R and RStudio](/blog/how-to-install-r-and-rstudio/)
* [How to import an Excel file in RStudio](/blog/how-to-import-an-excel-file-in-rstudio/)
* [Descriptive statistics by hand](/blog/descriptive-statistics-by-hand/) or [in R](/blog/descriptive-statistics-in-r/)

You can also:

* See [all articles](/blog/) or [articles by categories](/tags/) for more advanced articles
* Learn more [about me](/about/)
* [Subscribe to this blog](/subscribe/) to receive updates every time a new article is published
* See the [most recent comments](/recent-comments/) so you can follow the discussion
