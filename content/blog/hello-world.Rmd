This is the first post for the blog [Stats and R](/), just to introduce it. This blog aims at helping academics and professionals working with data to grasp important concepts in [statistics](/tags/statistics/) and to [apply them in R](/tags/r/).

If you are new to this blog and to R, I invite you to start with the following articles:

* [How to install R and RStudio](/blog/how-to-install-r-and-rstudio/)
* [How to import an Excel file in RStudio](/blog/how-to-import-an-excel-file-in-rstudio/)
* [Descriptive statistics by hand](/blog/descriptive-statistics-by-hand/) or [in R](/blog/descriptive-statistics-in-r/)

Thanks in advance for reading. As always, if you find a mistake/bug or if you have any questions do not hesitate to let me know in the comment section of the corresponding article, <a href="https://github.com/AntoineSoetewey/statsandr/issues" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raise an issue on GitHub</a> or [contact me](/contact/). Get updates every time a new article is published by [subscribing to this blog](/subscribe/).
