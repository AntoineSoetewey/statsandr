<p class="caption">A Shiny app to perform simple linear regression (by hand and in R)</p>
</div>
<p>Simple linear regression is a statistical method to summarize and study relationships between two variables. When more than two variables are of interest, it is referred as multiple linear regression. See this article on <a href="/blog/multiple-linear-regression-made-simple/">linear regression</a> for more details.</p>
<p>In this article, we focus only on a Shiny app which allows to perform simple linear regression by hand and in R:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://antoinesoetewey.shinyapps.io/statistics-202/" target="_blank">Statistics-202</a></strong></li>
</ul>
<div id="how-to-use-this-app" class="section level1">
<h1>How to use this app?</h1>
<p>Follow these steps:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Open the app via this <a href="https://antoinesoetewey.shinyapps.io/statistics-202/" target="_blank">link</a></li>
<li>Enter your data in the x and y fields. The x field corresponds to the independent variable, while the y field corresponds to the dependent variable</li>
<li>If you do not want to display the confidence interval around the regression line, uncheck the checkbox under Plot</li>
<li>Change the x and y-axis labels for the regression plot if needed</li>
</ol>
<p>In the results panel (on the right side or below depending on the size of your screen), you will see:</p>
<ul>
<li>a recap of your dataset together with some appropriate descriptive statistics</li>
<li>the estimates <span class="math inline">\(\beta_0\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\beta_1\)</span> and the regression model computed by hand</li>
<li>the results of the model computed in R</li>
<li>the regression plot with some key measures</li>
<li>the interpretations</li>
<li>and the assumptions to check the validity of the model</li>
</ul>
<p>All formulas, steps and computations to arrive at the final results are also provided.</p>
<p>Note that although the assumptions are displayed, it is your responsibility to check them to assess the validity of the linear model.</p>
<p>Last but not least, you can download a report of the results (in HTML) by clicking on the Download button, and you can choose whether you want to include the R code or not.</p>

<div id="code" class="section level1">
<h1>Code</h1>
<p>Here is the entire code (or see the last version on <a href="https://github.com/AntoineSoetewey/statistics-202" target="_blank">GitHub</a>) in case you would like to enhance it.</p>

<p><em>Note that the link may not work if the app has hit the monthly usage limit. Try again later if that is the case.</em></p>

<div id="conclusion" class="section level1">
<h1>Conclusion</h1>

<p>Thanks for reading.</p>
<p>I hope you will find this app useful to do simple linear regression by hand and in R.</p>
