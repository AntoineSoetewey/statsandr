# What is probability?

Probability is the likelihood of an event occurring; it is a mathematical model to describe random phenomena. In other words, probability is a branch of mathematics that provides models to describe random processes. These mathematical tools allow to establish theoretical models for random phenomena and to use them to make predictions. Like every model, the probabilistic model is a simplification of the world. However, the model is useful as soon as it captures the essential features.

In this article, we present xxx fundamental formulas and conceps in probability to get you started in data science.

1. A probability is always between 0 and 1

A probability of an event is always between 0 and 1,

$$0 \le P(A) \le 1$$
