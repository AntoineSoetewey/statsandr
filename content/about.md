Hello, my name is [Antoine Soetewey](https://www.antoinesoetewey.com/). I am a PhD student in statistics at UCLouvain (Belgium) within the Institute of Statistics, Biostatistics and Actuarial Sciences.^[All opinions and views are my own and do not represent my employer.] My research interests focus on survival analysis and bio-statistical procedures applied to cancer patients. See more in the research section of my [personal website](https://www.antoinesoetewey.com/research).

In parallel with my doctoral thesis, I am teaching assistant for several courses in statistics and probability at bachelor and masterâ€™s level. From time to time, I also provide trainings and workshops in statistics and R in a Belgian consulting company.

This blog aims at helping academics and professionals working with data to grasp important statistical concepts using examples and plain English. When possible, for all statistical concepts covered in this blog, I try to write an article on how to apply them in R. I will also occasionally present some work related to data science using R and news about my research.

I really enjoy learning new things. I learn (and I am still learning) a lot by teaching statistics to students from diverse backgrounds. So far, I believed that I understood a statistical concept only if I was able to teach it to my students. If I was not able to explain it in a clear and understandable way to my students, it meant that I needed to study it more carefully because I actually did not fully understand it.

With this blog, I have discovered that in order to understand and learn something new, one must be able to clearly (i) communicate it *and* more importantly, be able to (ii) write it down in a precise and concise manner. So although this blog was first launched to share statistical concepts I am most familiar with, I now use it to learn by writing. I think that this new way of learning is actually as powerful as teaching, and valuable feedback from people all over the world makes the whole journey even more interesting and enriching.

Thanks in advance for reading and feel free to [contact me](/contact/) if you have any questions, remarks or inquiries.
