Hello, my name is [Antoine Soetewey](https://www.antoinesoetewey.com/). I am a PhD student in statistics at UCLouvain (Belgium). My research interests focus on survival analysis and bio-statistical procedures applied to cancer patients.

In parallel with my doctoral thesis, I am teaching assistant for several courses in statistics and probability at bachelor and master’s level. I also provide trainings and workshops in statistics and R in a Belgian consulting company.

For more information about myself please visit [www.antoinesoetewey.com](https://www.antoinesoetewey.com/). All opinions and views are my own and do not represent my employer.

This blog was launched to help academics and professionals to grasp important statistical concepts, using examples and plain English. From time to time, I will also present some work related to data science using R.
