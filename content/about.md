Hello, my name is [Antoine Soetewey](https://www.antoinesoetewey.com/). I am a PhD student in statistics at UCLouvain (Belgium) within the Institute of Statistics, Biostatistics and Actuarial Sciences. My [research](https://www.antoinesoetewey.com/research/) interests focus on survival analysis and bio-statistical procedures applied to cancer patients.

In parallel with my doctoral thesis, I am [teaching assistant](https://www.antoinesoetewey.com/teaching/) for several courses in statistics and probability at bachelor and masterâ€™s level. From time to time, I also provide trainings and workshops in statistics and R programming for a Belgian consulting company. See my [CV](https://www.antoinesoetewey.com/cv/) to have a more detailed overview of my academic and professional background.

## Blog - What?

This blog is, as its name suggests, about [statistics](/tags/statistics/) and [R](/tags/r/). More specifically, it aims at helping academics and professionals working with data to grasp important statistical concepts using examples and plain English.

When possible, for all statistical concepts covered in this blog, I try to write an article on how to apply them in R (and share the code). I also occasionally present some work related to data science using R, news about my research and, to a smaller extent, my journey in the blogging world.

## Why?

[Stats and R](/) was launched in December 2019. Friends, family, colleagues and even some readers often ask why I started this blog. I really enjoy learning new things. I learn (and I am still learning) a lot by teaching statistics to students from diverse backgrounds.

So far, I believed that I understood a statistical concept only if I was able to teach it to my students. If I was not able to explain it in a clear and understandable way, it meant that I needed to study it more thoroughly because I actually did not fully understand it.

With this blog, I realized that in order to learn and fully understand something new, one must be able to:

* clearly communicate it
* *and* more importantly, be able to write it down in a precise and concise manner

So although this blog was first launched to share statistical concepts I am most familiar with, I now also use it to learn by writing. I think that this additional way of learning is actually as powerful as teaching.

Last but not least, valuable feedback from people all over the world makes the whole journey even more interesting and enriching.
