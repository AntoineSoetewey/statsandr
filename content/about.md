Hello, my name is [Antoine Soetewey](https://www.antoinesoetewey.com/). I am a PhD student in statistics at UCLouvain (Belgium) within the Institute of Statistics, Biostatistics and Actuarial Sciences ([ISBA](https://uclouvain.be/en/research-institutes/lidam/isba)). My [research](https://www.antoinesoetewey.com/research/) interests focus on survival analysis and bio-statistical procedures applied to cancer patients.

In parallel with my doctoral thesis, I am [teaching assistant](https://www.antoinesoetewey.com/teaching/) for several courses in statistics and probability at bachelor and master’s level. I also provide trainings/workshops and consulting in statistics and R programming as part of UCLouvain's technology platform for Support in Methodology and Statistical Computing ([SMCS](https://sites.uclouvain.be/smcs-gateway/)). See my [CV](https://www.antoinesoetewey.com/cv/) for a more detailed overview of my academic and professional background.

Given my experience, I also help academics and professionals in performing statistical data analyses for their academic or work related projects. Feel free to [contact me](/contact/) if you need help for your statistical analyses.

## Blog - What?

This blog is, as its name suggests, about [statistics](/tags/statistics/) and [R](/tags/r/). More specifically, it aims at helping academics and professionals working with data to grasp important statistical concepts using examples and plain English.

When possible, for all statistical concepts covered in this blog, I try to write an article on how to apply them in R (and share the code). I also occasionally present some work related to data science & [data visualization](/tags/visualization/) using R, news about my [research](/tags/research/) and, to a smaller extent, my journey in the [blogging](/tags/blogging/) world.

## Why?

[Stats and R](/) was launched in December 2019. Friends, family, colleagues and even some readers often ask why I started this blog.

I really enjoy learning new things. I learn (and I am still learning) a lot by teaching statistics to students from diverse backgrounds.

So far, I believed that I understood a statistical concept as soon as I was able to *teach* it to my students. If I was not able to explain it in a clear and understandable way, it meant that I needed to study it more thoroughly because I actually did not fully understand it.

Throughout this blog, I actually realized that in order to learn and **fully understand something new**, one must:

* be able to clearly communicate it and teach it in simple terms,
* but *also* be able to **write it down in a precise and concise manner**

So although this blog was first launched to share statistical concepts I am most familiar with (hoping that it would be useful to some people), I now also use it to **learn by writing**. I think that this additional way of learning is actually **as powerful as teaching** because writing allows me to **consolidate my understanding**.

Also, getting valuable feedback from people all over the world makes the whole journey even more interesting and enriching.

If you are interested in learning more why I launched this blog, see the article about the main [benefits of maintaining a technical blog](/blog/7-benefits-of-sharing-your-code-in-a-data-science-blog/).
