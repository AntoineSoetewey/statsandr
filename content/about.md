Hello, my name is <a href="https://www.antoinesoetewey.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Antoine Soetewey</a>. I am a PhD student in statistics at UCLouvain (Belgium). My research interests focus on survival analysis and bio-statistical procedures applied to cancer patients. In parallel with my doctoral thesis, I am teaching assistant for several courses in statistics and probability at bachelor and master’s level. I also provide trainings and workshops in statistics and R in a belgian consulting company. For more information about myself please visit <a href="https://www.antoinesoetewey.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Antoine Soetewey</a>.

This blog aims at helping academics (mainly students) and professionals (working with data) to grasp important concepts in statistics and to apply them in R.

If you need help in performing statistical data analyses for your thesis or academic/work related projects, do not hesitate to [contact me](/contact/).
