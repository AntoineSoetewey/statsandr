Hello, my name is [Antoine Soetewey](https://www.antoinesoetewey.com/). I am a PhD student in statistics at UCLouvain (Belgium) within the Institute of Statistics, Biostatistics and Actuarial Sciences. My research interests focus on survival analysis and bio-statistical procedures applied to cancer patients. See more in the research section of my [personal website](https://www.antoinesoetewey.com/research).

In parallel with my doctoral thesis, I am teaching assistant for several courses in statistics and probability at bachelor and masterâ€™s level. From time to time, I also provide trainings and workshops in statistics and R in a Belgian consulting company.

This blog was launched to help academics and professionals to grasp important statistical concepts, using examples and plain English. I will also occasionally present some work related to data science using R and news about my research.

Note that all opinions and views are my own and do not represent my employer.
