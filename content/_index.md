Welcome to the blog Stats and R. As the name suggests, this blog is about statistics and its applications in R (an open source statistical software program).

An objective of this blog is to make statistics accessible to everyone! Throughout different articles, I share, explain and illustrate statistical concepts, and when appropriate, apply them in R.

From time to time, I also present some work related to data science & data visualization using R, news about my research and, to a smaller extent, my journey in the blogging world.
