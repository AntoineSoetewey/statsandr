Welcome to the blog [Stats and R](/). As the name suggests, this blog is about statistics and its applications in R (statistical program). It aims at helping academics (mainly students) and professionals (working with data) to grasp important concepts in statistics and to apply them in R. Most of the time, for each topic I selected there are two articles: 

1. one from the theoritical perspective and how to apply it "by hand"
2. how to apply the concepts in R

See [all articles here](/blog/) or [articles by categories here](/categories/).

If you need help in performing statistical data analyses for your thesis or academic/work related projects, do not hesitate to [contact me](/contact/).
