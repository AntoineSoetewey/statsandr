Welcome to the blog [Stats and R](/). As the name suggests, this blog is about [statistics](/tags/statistics/) and its applications in [R](/tags/r/) (an open source statistical software program).

From time to time, I also present some work related to data science & [data visualization](/tags/visualization/) using R, and news about my research.
