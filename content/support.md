On this blog, I provide free articles and tutorials about [statistics](/tags/statistics/) and [R](/tags/r/). My goal with the blog is to help people to understand statistical concepts (through examples and in plain English), and to apply them in R.

All the [articles](/blog/), [Shiny apps](/tags/shiny/) and code are open source and available to everyone. I also try to reply to questions I receive from readers by emails or as comments.

I work on the blog voluntarily in my spare time (when I am not too busy working on my PhD thesis). Your support will help me to:

* Cover the costs of hosting the blog and my [Shiny apps](/tags/shiny/), in order to keep its access free!
* If your support becomes greater than the operating costs, it could also allow me to free up time to continue creating quality content and invest more time into the blog and the related [projects](https://github.com/AntoineSoetewey)

Here are the different ways you can support the blog:

1. [GitHub](#github)
1. [Share](#share)
1. [Follow](#follow)
1. [Recommendations](#recommendations)
1. [Amazon](#amazon)
