      <description>This is the first post for the blog Stats and R, just to introduce it. This blog aims at helping academics (mainly students) and professionals (working with data) to grasp important concepts in statistics and to apply them in R.
Thanks in advance for reading. As always, if you find a mistake/bug or if you have any questions do not hesitate to let me know in the comment section of the corresponding article, raise an issue on GitHub or contact me.</description>
