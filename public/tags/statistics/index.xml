      <description>Statistics is divided into two main branches:
 Descriptive statistics Inferential statistics  Descriptive statistics provide a summary of the data; it helps explaining the data in a concise way without losing too much information. Data can be summarized numerically or graphically. Inferential statistics use a random sample of data taken from a population to make inferences (i.e., to deduct) about the population. In other words, information from the sample is used to make generalizations about the parameter of interest in the population.</description>

      <description>Simple linear regression is a statistical method to summarize and study relationships between two variables. When more than two variables are of interest, it is referred as multiple linear regression.
In this article, we focus only on a Shiny app which allows to perform simple linear regression by hand and in R:
 Statistics-202  For further details about what is linear regression and when it is used, please see the numerous resources on the topic available in textbooks and online.</description>

      <description>Below a Shiny app to help you read the main statistical tables:
 Statistics-101  This Shiny app helps you to compute probabilities for the main probability distributions.
How to use this app? Open the app via this link Choose the distribution Set the paremeter(s) of the distribution (the parameters depend of course on the chosen distribution) Select whether you want to find the lower tail, upper tail or an interval Choose the value of x  On the right panel (or below depending on the size of your screen) you will see:</description>
