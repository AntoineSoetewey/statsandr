&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/blog/2020-09-02-why-do-i-blog-5-benefits-of-sharing-your-code_files/why-do-i-blog-5-benefits-of-sharing-your-code.jpeg&#34; style=&#34;width:100.0%&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My blog &lt;a href=&#34;/&#34;&gt;statsandr.com&lt;/a&gt; was launched in December 2019. Although 9 months of writing is a very short period compared to others, I can already say that it’s been an incredible and very enriching adventure!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With &lt;a href=&#34;/blog/&#34;&gt;45 articles&lt;/a&gt; published (at the time of writing this article) and topics ranging from &lt;a href=&#34;/blog/descriptive-statistics-in-r/&#34;&gt;descriptive statistics&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;/blog/the-9-concepts-and-formulas-in-probability-that-every-data-scientist-should-know/&#34;&gt;probability&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;/blog/student-s-t-test-in-r-and-by-hand-how-to-compare-two-groups-under-different-scenarios/&#34;&gt;inferential statistics&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&#34;/tags/r-markdown/&#34;&gt;R Markdown&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;/blog/graphics-in-r-with-ggplot2/&#34;&gt;data visualization&lt;/a&gt;, I have seen many benefits of sharing my code through a technical blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this article, I highlight 7 of them (in no particular order) with the hope that it will give ideas and incentives to some of you. In the end of this article, I also mention a couple of modern solutions needed for starting your own blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that in these 9 months, I did not make a living from my blog and this is not my goal as I would need to make it a priority.&lt;a href=&#34;#fn1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref1&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; However, I have received enough positive feedback from readers, and more importantly, I have learned enough to continue writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;learn-by-writing&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;#1 Learn by writing&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really enjoy learning new stuff in many different domains. I learn (and I am still learning) a lot by teaching statistics to students from diverse backgrounds as part of my &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.antoinesoetewey.com/teaching/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;teaching assistant&lt;/a&gt; position at university.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before launching this blog, I believed that I understood a statistical concept as soon as I was able to &lt;em&gt;teach&lt;/em&gt; it to my students. If I was not able to explain it in a clear and understandable way, it meant that I needed to study it more thoroughly because I actually did not fully understand it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is often referred as the Feynman technique. This method of learning is based on the fact that in order to fully master a topic you need to be able to explain it back to someone in simple terms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout this blog, I actually realized that in order to learn and &lt;strong&gt;fully understand something new&lt;/strong&gt;, one must:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;be able to clearly communicate it and teach it in simple terms,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;but &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; be able to &lt;strong&gt;write it down in a precise and concise manner&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So although this blog was first launched to share statistical concepts I am most familiar with (hoping that it would be useful to some people), I now also use it to &lt;strong&gt;learn by writing&lt;/strong&gt;. I think that this additional way of learning is actually &lt;strong&gt;as powerful as teaching&lt;/strong&gt; because writing allows me to &lt;strong&gt;consolidate my understanding&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously, I am learning mainly about &lt;a href=&#34;/tags/statistics/&#34;&gt;statistics&lt;/a&gt; and its applications in &lt;a href=&#34;/tags/r/&#34;&gt;R&lt;/a&gt; as they are the main topics of the blog. However, I never thought that I would also learn so much about:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;web development and SEO/analytics (which are increasingly important skills nowadays)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;project management (as you build something from scratch and wish to develop it)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;writing (a skill I still need to improve as a non-native English speaker)&lt;a href=&#34;#fn2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref2&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;communicating results (as any data scientist will tell you, results without proper communication are useless and writing a blog is a great practice)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;marketing/public relation/brand management (think about social networking and how to deal with all sorts of questions from readers)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maintaining a blog teaches me essential skills that are usually taught in full-time jobs. With a blog, you are responsible of everything from the content to readers’ inquiries, similar to an employee in charge of a project and who has to deal and communicate with end users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t get me wrong, apart from exceptions, I do not think that a blog can completely replace a job in terms of personal development, but it definitely helps to learn a broad range of important skills. Reading books and completing data science online courses are other examples to gain skills in addition to a job, but a blog tends to be more diverse and applied, making it more beneficial (in my opinion).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another way I am learning is by &lt;strong&gt;doing research about the topic I am writing about&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An example of it is my post on &lt;a href=&#34;/blog/outliers-detection-in-r/&#34;&gt;outliers detection in R&lt;/a&gt;. As part of any &lt;a href=&#34;/blog/descriptive-statistics-in-r/&#34;&gt;descriptive analysis&lt;/a&gt;, I am used to check for potential outliers. Since I was familiar with this topic, I decided to write about it. However, I found the post not complete enough so I did some further research. It turned out that there were in fact several statistical tests that I did not know about. I wrote about these tests and I now include these new techniques whenever I check for potential outliers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last but not least, I often receive emails from readers asking to write about a topic of their choice. It sometimes happens that I never heard about their suggested topic, so I do some research out of curiosity. Even if I still do not write about it because I am not familiar enough with it, at least I am aware that it exists and I know more or less what this is about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the sole benefit of learning did not convince you to start your blog, see other benefits I have experienced in the following sections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;get-feedback&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;#2 Get feedback&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get feedback&lt;/strong&gt;, suggestions and constructive critics &lt;strong&gt;from more experienced users&lt;/strong&gt;. Remarks greatly help in correcting typos and bugs present in my code, and they also help in improving my R skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will be amazed to see that, although you spent countless hours to check your code, there will always be someone who will spot a typo that you missed. Valuable feedback from people all over the world has, for instance, definitely improved the quality and completeness of my &lt;a href=&#34;/tags/shiny/&#34;&gt;R Shiny applications&lt;/a&gt; that I use on a daily basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A blog can therefore be seen as a &lt;strong&gt;powerful peer-review method&lt;/strong&gt; of your understanding of a concept, code or R practices. It is also better to make mistakes when working on a toy example and correct them, than to make mistakes on a real project at your workplace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, some people aggregate their blog posts into articles or books, so blogging can be seen as a way to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;make incremental progress toward a longer-term publishing goal, and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;receive feedback at each step of this long-term goal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;personal-note-to-remind-my-future-self&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;#3 Personal note to remind my future self&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How many times you searched for a piece of code in the folders of your computer, to finally look for the solution on Google because you could not remember for which project you wrote that piece of code? It happened to me every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With blog posts organized by &lt;a href=&#34;/tags/&#34;&gt;topics&lt;/a&gt;, it now takes me much less time (and less frustration!) to &lt;strong&gt;find code snippets that I wrote several months ago&lt;/strong&gt;. This also allows me to keep my &lt;strong&gt;code and R practices up-to-date&lt;/strong&gt;, as I only have to edit them in one place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An example of this is my article about &lt;a href=&#34;/blog/graphics-in-r-with-ggplot2/&#34;&gt;graphics in R with &lt;code&gt;{ggplot2}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. I prefer plots with the &lt;code&gt;{ggplot2}&lt;/code&gt; package over plots available by default in R base, but I cannot remember all layers and their arguments. Now every time I struggle with a plot using this package, I simply revisit the corresponding article to find the solution. Same goes for many of my articles, every time I have forgotten the code or a nuance around how it works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You could store your code in different files (&lt;a href=&#34;/blog/getting-started-in-r-markdown/&#34;&gt;R Markdown&lt;/a&gt; documents or R scripts for example, as I used to do in the past), but blog posts have the advantages that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;code snippets are highlighted, and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;by making it available to the world, you are forced to keep it tidy, complete and up-to-date.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;contribute-to-the-open-source-community&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;#4 Contribute to the open source community&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have learned so much and I keep learning everyday about R thanks to great resources made available for free by developers and scientists who believe in &lt;strong&gt;open source and free materials&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Making all my code and articles freely available through a blog is in some sense, my way of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“paying back” people who helped me to learn and thanks to whom I stand where I am now, and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;pay in advance the many more from who I will learn in the future.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you also believe in sharing your knowledge or expertise, having a blog is definitely a great way to &lt;strong&gt;contribute to the community&lt;/strong&gt;. Your contribution does not necessarily have to be huge, as long as it adds something, someone will use it. Remember that everyone started as a beginner, and even world experts are beginners in other domains. And you will see that as you keep sharing your knowledge with others, some people will appreciate it because they can learn from it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As far as I am concerned, if my small contribution is useful for some people in having a better understanding of statistics or in learning R, my goal will be reached. Others who believe passionately in a topic may want to inform people about it, in the hope that more people in turn contribute to the topic. You are totally &lt;strong&gt;free to choose the contribution&lt;/strong&gt; you want to make to the community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;stay-humble-stay-curious&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;#5 Stay humble, stay curious&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since launching my blog, I discovered plenty of other data science blogs of high quality. The more I see new things about different topics and the more I see people doing incredible stuff, the more I realize that I actually do not know much. This reminds me to &lt;strong&gt;stay humble&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to that, by sharing my code with scientists from diverse backgrounds and coming from all over the world, it allows me to &lt;strong&gt;consider other perspectives&lt;/strong&gt; and practice open-mindedness, which in turn helps me to &lt;strong&gt;stay curious&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being humble and curious is, in my opinion, a good starting point to keep learning. I would not want to lose my curiosity, otherwise I may lose my appetite for learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For your information, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.r-bloggers.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;R-bloggers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://rweekly.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;R Weekly&lt;/a&gt; are two great blog aggregators focusing on R, and the &lt;a href=&#34;https://towardsdatascience.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Towards Data Science&lt;/a&gt; publication on Medium is full of high quality blog posts covering many topics related to data science. Subscribe to these if you are interested in discovering more technical blogs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;learn-to-be-less-perfectionist-and-to-prioritize&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;#6 Learn to be less perfectionist and to prioritize&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No matter how much time you spend on your blog, remember that &lt;strong&gt;everything cannot always be perfect&lt;/strong&gt;. As a perfectionist, I cannot deny that I would love everything to run perfectly in all aspects of my life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time of writing my first articles, my tendency for perfectionism was sometimes so prevalent that it was a real weakness: I could spend several minutes thinking whether a comma between two words was needed or not (which would of course make no difference at all). However, at some point, &lt;strong&gt;improving something takes so much time and energy that the added value is not as large as the added value you could create by devoting your time in producing something new&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This gets even worse as you keep learning every day. As a consequence, an article which seemed to be perfect in the past may no longer be viewed as perfect today, so you want to change or add a small detail in all your previous articles. I am not saying you should not edit a blog post, it is even recommended! Nonetheless, I advise you to edit it only if it really adds a significant value to it. Otherwise, I believe it is best to spend that time and effort in creating something else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a blog you will thus gradually learn to put your effort and time (which are limited resources and seem to be scarcer with the years) where it is most productive. In other words, you will learn to &lt;strong&gt;prioritize&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;build-connections-and-professional-relationships&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;#7 Build connections and professional relationships&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By sharing your practices in a specific field, you sometimes come across people who actually work on the same topic than you or have similar research interests. This was the case, among others, with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My &lt;a href=&#34;/blog/top-r-resources-on-covid-19-coronavirus/&#34;&gt;collection of top R resources on Coronavirus&lt;/a&gt;. It started with only 5 resources, then as I was gradually adding more and more resources, Rees Morrison who was collecting blog posts on the same topic contacted me and I added his blog posts to the original collection.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The presentation of a R package developed by Renan Xavier Cortes which could be used to &lt;a href=&#34;/blog/a-package-to-download-free-springer-books-during-covid-19-quarantine/&#34;&gt;download free Springer books during Covid-19 quarantine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My article on the analysis of the spread of &lt;a href=&#34;/blog/covid-19-in-belgium/&#34;&gt;COVID-19 in Belgium&lt;/a&gt;, which led, in collaboration with three other researchers, to a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.antoinesoetewey.com/files/slides-how-can-we-predict-the-evolution-of-covid-19-in-Belgium.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;seminar&lt;/a&gt; and the creation of graphs representing &lt;a href=&#34;/blog/covid-19-in-belgium-is-it-over-yet/&#34;&gt;COVID-19 hospital admissions in Belgium&lt;/a&gt; (which were later used by a Belgian news television channel).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These &lt;strong&gt;collaborations extended my professional network&lt;/strong&gt; and allowed me to build connections with new researchers from different universities and from different countries. I would never have known these people without first sharing my analyses on a specific topic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am sure that a blog can lead to numerous collaborations, making the whole journey even more interesting and enriching. And who knows, the next chapter of your professional life may be shaped by one person with whom you have worked in the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if your blog does not lead to any collaboration, it is still a &lt;strong&gt;great tool for self-promotion&lt;/strong&gt;. Doing some research, practicing, and writing about a topic help to become (and to be seen as) an &lt;strong&gt;expert&lt;/strong&gt; in the field. Moreover, your blog will become your &lt;strong&gt;portfolio&lt;/strong&gt; when applying for jobs or projects. Recruiters will definitely appreciate to see what you are capable of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether your blog is at the origin of some fruitful collaborations or a showcase of your work, it is a &lt;strong&gt;valuable asset&lt;/strong&gt; when applying for your dream job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;how-to-start-your-own-blog&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;How to start your own blog?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have seen an acceleration in my learning curve, a deeper understanding of statistics and R, and a large improvement in my communication skills since starting my blog. I never realized how useful maintaining a blog could be as a learning technique. This comes with the added benefit of being able to store information and code for myself and for others to also use, which is essential for getting feedback and connecting with other researchers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If these 7 benefits have convinced you, the good news is that nowadays it is cheaper and easier than ever to start your own blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For non-technical blogs I recommend Medium or WordPress because it is easy to set up and it does not require code. For &lt;strong&gt;technical blogs&lt;/strong&gt;, there are plenty of &lt;strong&gt;static site generators&lt;/strong&gt; to choose from but I highly recommend using &lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.io/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Hugo&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&#34;https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;{blogdown}&lt;/code&gt; package&lt;/a&gt; (I created my blog after reading this book). You can then host it on &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; and publish it using &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.netlify.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Netlify&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;a href=&#34;#fn3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref3&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading. I hope this article answered questions such as “Why do you have a blog?” or “What is the purpose of it?”, and who knows, gave you the motivation to start your own blog. If you are still undecided, I truly recommend to do it and remember that the hardest part is to start. If you are patient and passionate about a topic, you simply have to start and the rest will follow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As always, if you have a question or a suggestion related to the topic covered in this article, please add it as a comment so other readers can benefit from the discussion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34;&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn1&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;I intentionally avoided to write about financial incentives in this article because I believe that it is not a good motivation to start a blog. First, many people do not make money with their blog and never will. Second, it is true that there are also a lot of people who make money with their blog, but for most of them the money is not worth the time. I see from my personal experience that a blog can sometimes be so time consuming that I would definitely make money more easily somewhere else. Moreover, as you can see, I chose not to put advertising or banner as I think that it deteriorates the reading experience (I find ads and banners extremely annoying when I see them on other blogs). This is of course my opinion it remains a matter of personal choice, and a matter of trade off: worse reading experience and more money versus better reading experience and less money. I also tend to prefer to leave the choice to readers to &lt;a href=&#34;/support/&#34;&gt;support my projects&lt;/a&gt; than to impose them ads or banners.&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-back&#34;&gt;↩︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn2&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even native English speakers can improve their writing skills with a blog.&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-back&#34;&gt;↩︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn3&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note that I am not a programmer nor a computer scientist so I do not have extensive knowledge in creating websites. There must be many more options available but I find these options the most optimal choices given my computer skills and my goals.&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-back&#34;&gt;↩︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;div id=&#34;introduction&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently moved out and bought my first apartment. Of course, I could not pay it entirely with my own savings, so I had to borrow money from the bank. I visited a couple of banks operating in my country and asked for a mortgage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you already bought your house or apartment in the past, you know how it goes: the bank analyzes your financial and personal situation and make an offer based on your propensity to repay the bank. You then either accept the offer if you are satisfied with the rate and conditions, or visit another bank if you believe you could receive a better offer. Mortgages and loans are more complicated than that of course, but let’s keep it simple here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I kind of like to control and keep a close eye on my &lt;a href=&#34;/blog/practical-guide-on-optimal-asset-allocation/&#34;&gt;personal finances&lt;/a&gt; (sometimes a bit too close I must admit), I knew precisely how much I could spend for my monthly mortgage repayment while still being able to cover my living expenses. However, I had no clue how much I could borrow in total for my new apartment given these housing repayments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I knew I was not the first person in this case, so I looked online if I could find a R script which would answer my question (and potentially also give me the total cost of the housing loan, including the loan amount and the accumulated interests). I finally found a R script created a while ago by Prof. Thomas Girke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;mortgage-calculator&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Mortgage calculator&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The function in the script was functional and solved my main issue, but I wanted to be able to play more easily with the different settings such as the amount, the duration and the interest rate of the loan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this reason, I created a &lt;strong&gt;R Shiny app&lt;/strong&gt; which is &lt;strong&gt;available here:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://antoinesoetewey.shinyapps.io/mortgage-calculator/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Mortgage calculator&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;figure&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;/blog/2020-08-14-mortgage-calculator-in-r-shiny_files/mortgage-calculator-r-shiny.png&#34; style=&#34;width:100.0%&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;Mortgage calculator in R Shiny&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, I received an Excel file from a friend working in a Belgian bank which does precisely the same task. I am not an actuary nor a expert in mortgage loan, so with his file I was able to cross check the results and edit the code accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The app greatly helped me to know the maximum amount I could borrow from the bank by playing with the three main settings of a mortgage, so it gave me a precise price limit when looking for apartments online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that the app can of course be used for any loan, not only for mortgage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;how-to-use-the-mortgage-calculator&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;How to use the mortgage calculator?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, you can find the mortgage calculator &lt;a href=&#34;https://antoinesoetewey.shinyapps.io/mortgage-calculator/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I try to keep all my &lt;a href=&#34;/tags/shiny/&#34;&gt;Shiny apps&lt;/a&gt; easy to use for everyone. However, here is how to use it in case it is not intuitive enough:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol style=&#34;list-style-type: decimal&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enter the amount of the loan (i.e., the amount you would like to borrow, do not include downpayment)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enter the annual interest rate in %&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enter the duration of the loan in years&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the right panel (or bottom if you use the app on mobile) you will see:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a summary repeating the settings you entered,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the total cost of the loan (principal and interests included), and more importantly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the amount of the monthly payments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A plot representing the percentage attributed to the repayment of the interests and the capital is also displayed. You see that (especially in the first years of the loan), the higher the interest rate and the duration of the loan, the higher the percentage of the monthly repayments is attributed to the repayments of the interests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the amortization table showing the remaining balance month by month is displayed after the summary and the plot. You can copy, export (in PDF, CSV or Excel) or print this amortization table for further use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;code-of-the-app&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Code of the app&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below the entire code in case you would like to enhance the app (feel free to send me your app if you happen to improve it!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;script src=&#34;https://gist.github.com/AntoineSoetewey/c4cf29983f7b0695e492d53795355c4c.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading. I hope this &lt;a href=&#34;https://antoinesoetewey.shinyapps.io/mortgage-calculator/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;mortgage calculator&lt;/a&gt; helped you to play with the different settings of a mortgage, and who knows, helped you to decide which house or apartment to buy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id=&#34;introduction&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of my teaching assistant position in a Belgian university, students often ask me for some help in their statistical analyses for their master’s thesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A frequent question is how to compare groups of patients in terms of several &lt;a href=&#34;/blog/variable-types-and-examples/#continuous&#34;&gt;quantitative continuous&lt;/a&gt; variables. Most of us know that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To compare two groups, a &lt;a href=&#34;/blog/student-s-t-test-in-r-and-by-hand-how-to-compare-two-groups-under-different-scenarios/&#34;&gt;Student’s t-test&lt;/a&gt; should be used&lt;a href=&#34;#fn1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref1&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To compare three groups or more, an ANOVA should be performed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These two tests are quite basic and have been extensively documented online and in statistical textbooks so the difficulty is not in how to perform these tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past, I used to do the analyses by following these 3 steps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol style=&#34;list-style-type: decimal&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Draw boxplots illustrating the distributions by group (with the &lt;code&gt;boxplot()&lt;/code&gt; function or thanks to the &lt;a href=&#34;/blog/rstudio-addins-or-how-to-make-your-coding-life-easier/#esquisse&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;{esquisse}&lt;/code&gt; R Studio addin&lt;/a&gt; if I wanted to use the &lt;a href=&#34;/blog/graphics-in-r-with-ggplot2/&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;{ggplot2}&lt;/code&gt; package&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perform a t-test or an ANOVA depending on the number of groups to compare (with the &lt;code&gt;t.test()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;oneway.test()&lt;/code&gt; functions for t-test and ANOVA, respectively)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Repeat steps 1 and 2 for each variable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was feasible as long as there were only a couple of variables to test. Nonetheless, most students came to me asking to perform these kind of tests not on one or two variables, but on &lt;strong&gt;multiples&lt;/strong&gt; variables. So when there were more than one variable to test, I quickly realized that I was wasting my time and that there must be a more efficient way to do the job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: you must be very careful with the issue of multiple testing (also referred as multiplicity) which can arise when you perform multiple t-tests. In short, when a large number of statistical tests are performed, some will have p-values less than 0.05 purely by chance, even if all null hypotheses are in fact really true. This is known as multiplicity or multiple testing. You can tackle this problem by using the Bonferroni correction, among others. The Bonferroni correction is a simple method that allows many t-tests to be made while still assuring an overall confidence level is maintained. For this, instead of using the standard threshold of &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\alpha = 5\)&lt;/span&gt;% for the significance level, you can use &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\alpha = \frac{0.05}{m}\)&lt;/span&gt; where &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(m\)&lt;/span&gt; is the number of t-tests. For example, if you perform 20 t-tests with a desired &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\alpha = 0.05\)&lt;/span&gt;, the Bonferroni correction implies that you would reject the null hypothesis for each individual test when the p-value is smaller than &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\alpha = \frac{0.05}{20} = 0.0025\)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note also that there is no universally accepted approach for dealing with the problem of multiple comparisons. Usually, you should choose a &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;-value adjustment measure familiar to your audience or in your field of study. The Bonferroni correction is the most common way to take this into account and is easy to implement. It is however not appropriate if you have a very large number of tests to perform (imagine you want to do 10,000 t-tests, a &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;-value would have to be less than &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\frac{0.05}{10000} = 0.000005\)&lt;/span&gt; to be significant). A more powerful method is also to adjust the false discovery rate using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure (McDonald, 2014). This article aims at presenting a way to perform multiple t-tests and ANOVA from a technical point of view (how to implement it in R). Discussion on which adjustment method to use or whether there is a more appropriate model to fit the data is beyond the scope of this article (so be sure to understand the implications of using the code below for your own analyses).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;perform-multiple-tests-at-once&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Perform multiple tests at once&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thus wrote a piece of code that automated the process, by drawing boxplots and performing the tests on several variables at once. Below is the code I used, illustrating the process with the &lt;code&gt;iris&lt;/code&gt; dataset. The &lt;code&gt;Species&lt;/code&gt; variable has 3 levels, so let’s remove one, and then draw a boxplot and apply a t-test on all 4 continuous variables at once. Note that the continuous variables that we would like to test are variables 1 to 4 in the &lt;code&gt;iris&lt;/code&gt; dataset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;dat &amp;lt;- iris

# remove one level to have only two groups
dat &amp;lt;- subset(dat, Species != &amp;quot;setosa&amp;quot;)
dat$Species &amp;lt;- factor(dat$Species)

# boxplots and t-tests for the 4 variables at once
for (i in 1:4) { # variables to compare are variables 1 to 4
  boxplot(dat[, i] ~ dat$Species, # draw boxplots by group
    ylab = names(dat[i]), # rename y-axis with variable&amp;#39;s name
    xlab = &amp;quot;Species&amp;quot;
  )
  print(t.test(dat[, i] ~ dat$Species)) # print results of t-test
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see, the above piece of code draws a boxplot and then prints results of the test for each continuous variable, all at once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At some point in the past, I even wrote code to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol style=&#34;list-style-type: decimal&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;draw a boxplot&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;test for the equality of variances (thanks to the Levene’s test)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;depending on whether the variances were equal or unequal, the appropriate test was applied: the Welch test if the variances were unequal and the Student’s t-test in the case the variances were equal (see more details about the different versions of the &lt;a href=&#34;/blog/student-s-t-test-in-r-and-by-hand-how-to-compare-two-groups-under-different-scenarios/&#34;&gt;t-test for two samples&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;apply steps 1 to 3 for all continuous variables at once&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had a similar code for ANOVA in case I needed to compare more than two groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The code was doing the job relatively well. Indeed, thanks to this code I was able to test several variables in an automated way in the sense that it compared groups for all variables at once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only thing I had to change from one project to another is that I needed to modify the name of the grouping variable and the numbering of the continuous variables to test (&lt;code&gt;Species&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;1:4&lt;/code&gt; in the above code).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;concise-and-easily-interpretable-results&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Concise and easily interpretable results&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;t-test&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;T-test&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although it was working quite well and applicable to different projects with only minor changes, I was still unsatisfied with another point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Someone who is proficient in statistics and R can read and interpret the output of a t-test without any difficulty. However, as you may have noticed with your own statistical projects, most people do not know what to look for in the results and are sometimes a bit confused when they see so many graphs, code, output, results and numeric values in a document. They are quite easily overwhelmed by this mass of information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With my old R routine, the time I was saving by automating the process of t-tests and ANOVA was (partially) lost when I had to explain R outputs to my students so that they could interpret the results correctly. Although most of the time it simply boiled down to pointing out what to look for in the outputs (i.e., &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;-values), I was still losing quite a lot of time because these outputs were, in my opinion, too detailed for most real-life applications. In other words, too much information seemed to be confusing for many people so I was still not convinced that it was the most optimal way to share statistical results to nonscientists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, they came to me for statistical advices, so they expected to have these results and I needed to give them answers to their questions and hypotheses. Nonetheless, I wanted to find a better way to communicate these results to this type of audience, with the minimum of information required to arrive at a conclusion. No more and no less than that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a long time spent online trying to figure out a way to present results in a more concise and readable way, I discovered the &lt;a href=&#34;https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggpubr/index.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;{ggpubr}&lt;/code&gt; package&lt;/a&gt;. This package allows to indicate the test used and the &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;-value of the test directly on a ggplot2-based graph. It also facilitates the creation of publication-ready plots for non-advanced statistical audiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After many refinements and modifications of the initial code (available in this &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sthda.com/english/articles/24-ggpubr-publication-ready-plots/76-add-p-values-and-significance-levels-to-ggplots/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt;), I finally came up with a rather stable and robust process to perform t-tests and ANOVA for more than one variable at once, and more importantly, make the results concise and easily readable by anyone (statisticians or not).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A graph is worth a thousand words, so here are the exact same tests than in the previous section, but this time with my new R routine:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;library(ggpubr)

# Edit from here #

&lt;p&gt;As you can see from the graphs above, only the most important information is presented for each variable:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a visual comparison of the groups thanks to boxplots&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the name of the statistical test&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;-value of the test&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, experts may be interested in more advanced results. However, this simple yet complete graph, which includes the name of the test and the &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;-value, gives all the necessary information to answer the question: “Are the groups different?”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my experience, I have noticed that students and professionals (especially those from a less scientific background) understand way better these results than the ones presented in the previous section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only lines of code that need to be modified for your own project is the name of the grouping variable (&lt;code&gt;Species&lt;/code&gt; in the above code), the names of the variables you want to test (&lt;code&gt;Sepal.Length&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Sepal.Width&lt;/code&gt;, etc.),&lt;a href=&#34;#fn2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref2&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; whether you want to apply a t-test (&lt;code&gt;t.test&lt;/code&gt;) or Wilcoxon test (&lt;code&gt;wilcox.test&lt;/code&gt;) and whether the samples are paired or not (&lt;code&gt;FALSE&lt;/code&gt; if samples are independent, &lt;code&gt;TRUE&lt;/code&gt; if they are paired).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on these graphs, it is easy, even for non-experts, to interpret the results and conclude that the &lt;code&gt;versicolor&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;virginica&lt;/code&gt; species are significantly different in terms of all 4 variables (since all &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;-values &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(&amp;lt; \frac{0.05}{4} = 0.0125\)&lt;/span&gt; (remind that the Bonferroni correction is applied to avoid the issue of multiple testing, so we divide the usual &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\alpha\)&lt;/span&gt; level by 4 because there are 4 t-tests)).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Additional &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;-value adjustment methods&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you would like to use another &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;-value adjustment method, you can use the &lt;code&gt;p.adjust()&lt;/code&gt; function. Below are the raw &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;-values found above, together with &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;-values derived from the main adjustment methods (presented in a dataframe):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;raw_pvalue &amp;lt;- numeric(length = length(1:4))
for (i in (1:4)) {
  raw_pvalue[i] &amp;lt;- t.test(dat[, i] ~ dat$Species,
    paired = FALSE,
    alternative = &amp;quot;two.sided&amp;quot;
  )$p.value
}

df &amp;lt;- data.frame(
  Variable = names(dat[, 1:4]),
  raw_pvalue = round(raw_pvalue, 3)
)

df$Bonferroni &amp;lt;-
  p.adjust(df$raw_pvalue,
    method = &amp;quot;bonferroni&amp;quot;
  )
df$BH &amp;lt;-
  p.adjust(df$raw_pvalue,
    method = &amp;quot;BH&amp;quot;

  )
df$BY &amp;lt;-
  round(p.adjust(df$raw_pvalue,
    method = &amp;quot;BY&amp;quot;
  ), 3)
df&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;##       Variable raw_pvalue Bonferroni    BH  Holm Hochberg Hommel    BY

&lt;p&gt;Regardless of the &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;-value adjustment method, the two species are different for all 4 variables. Note that the adjustment method should be chosen before looking at the results to avoid choosing the method based on the results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below another function that allows to perform multiple Student’s t-tests or Wilcoxon tests at once and choose the &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;-value adjustment method. The function also allows to specify whether samples are paired or unpaired and whether the variances are assumed to be equal or not. (The code has been adapted from Mark White’s &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.markhw.com/blog/t-table&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Applied to our dataset, with no adjustment method for the &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;-values:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;result &amp;lt;- t_table(

## 3 Petal.Length  &amp;lt;0.001 Reject H0 at 5%
## 4  Petal.Width  &amp;lt;0.001 Reject H0 at 5%&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And with the &lt;span class=&#34;citation&#34;&gt;Holm (1979)&lt;/span&gt; adjustment method:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;result &amp;lt;- t_table(
  data = dat,

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;##       variable p_value      conclusion

## 3 Petal.Length  &amp;lt;0.001 Reject H0 at 5%
## 4  Petal.Width  &amp;lt;0.001 Reject H0 at 5%&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, with the Holm’s adjustment method, we conclude that, at the 5% significance level, the two species are significantly different from each other in terms of all 4 variables.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like the improved routine for the t-test, I have noticed that students and non-expert professionals understand ANOVA results presented this way much more easily compared to the default R outputs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With one graph for each variable, it is easy to see that all species are different from each other in terms of all 4 variables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to apply the same automated process to your data, you will need to modify the name of the grouping variable (&lt;code&gt;Species&lt;/code&gt;), the names of the variables you want to test (&lt;code&gt;Sepal.Length&lt;/code&gt;, etc.), whether you want to perform an ANOVA (&lt;code&gt;anova&lt;/code&gt;) or Kruskal-Wallis test (&lt;code&gt;kruskal.test&lt;/code&gt;) and finally specify the comparisons for the post-hoc tests.&lt;a href=&#34;#fn3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref3&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;to-go-even-further&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;To go even further&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we have seen, these two improved R routines allow to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol style=&#34;list-style-type: decimal&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perform t-tests and ANOVA on a small or large number of variables with only minor changes to the code. I basically only have to replace the variable names and the name of the test I want to use. It takes almost the same time to test one or several variables so it is quite an improvement compared to testing one variable at a time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Share test results in a much proper and cleaner way. This is possible thanks to a graph showing the observations by group and the &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;-value of the appropriate test included on this graph. This is particularily important when communicating results to a wider audience or to people from diverse backgrounds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, like most of my R routines, these two pieces of code are still a work in progress. Below are some additional features I have been thinking of and which could be added in the future to make the process of comparing two or more groups even more optimal:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add the possibility to select variables by their numbering in the dataframe. For the moment it is only possible to do it via their names. This will allow to automate the process even further because instead of typing all variable names one by one, we could simply type &lt;code&gt;4:25&lt;/code&gt; (to test variables 4 to 25 for instance).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add the possibility to choose a &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;-value adjustment method. Currently, raw &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;-values are displayed in the graphs and I manually adjust them afterwards.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When comparing more than two groups, it is only possible to apply an ANOVA or Kruskal-Wallis test at the moment. A major improvement would be to add the possibility to perform a repeated measures ANOVA (i.e., an ANOVA when the samples are dependent). It is currently already possible to do a t-test with two paired samples, but it is not yet possible to do the same with more than two groups.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Another less important (yet still nice) feature when comparing more than 2 groups would be to automatically apply post-hoc tests only in the case where the null hypothesis of the ANOVA or Kruskal-Wallis test is rejected (so when there is at least one group different from the others, because if the null hypothesis of equal groups is not rejected we do not apply a post-hoc test). At the present time, I manually add or remove the code that displays the &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;-values of post-hoc tests depending on the global &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;-value of the ANOVA or Kruskal-Wallis test.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will try to add these features in the future, or I would be glad to help if the author of the &lt;code&gt;{ggpubr}&lt;/code&gt; package needs help in including these features (I hope he will see this article!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last but not least, the following packages may be of interest to some readers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you want to report statistical results on a graph, I advise you to check the &lt;a href=&#34;https://indrajeetpatil.github.io/ggstatsplot/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;{ggstatsplot}&lt;/code&gt; package&lt;/a&gt; and in particular the &lt;a href=&#34;https://indrajeetpatil.github.io/ggstatsplot/articles/web_only/ggbetweenstats.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;ggbetweenstats()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; function. This function allows to compare a continuous variable across multiple groups or conditions. Note that many different statistical results are displayed on the graph, not only the name of the test and the &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;-value. However, it is still very convenient to be able to include tests results on a graph in order to combine the advantages of a visualization and a sound statistical analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.r-project.org/web/packages/compareGroups/index.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;{compareGroups}&lt;/code&gt; package&lt;/a&gt; also provides a nice way to compare groups. It comes with a really complete Shiny app, available with:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# install.packages(&amp;quot;compareGroups&amp;quot;)

&lt;li id=&#34;fn1&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;In theory, an ANOVA can also be used to compare two groups as it will give the same results compared to a Student’s t-test, but in practice we use the Student’s t-test to compare two samples and the ANOVA to compare three samples or more.&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-back&#34;&gt;↩︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn2&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do not forget to separate the variables you want to test with &lt;code&gt;|&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-back&#34;&gt;↩︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn3&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Post-hoc test is only the name used to refer to a specific type of statistical tests. Post-hoc test includes, among others, the Tukey HSD test, the Bonferroni correction, Dunnett’s test. Even if an ANOVA or a Kruskal-Wallis test can determine whether there is at least one group that is different from the others, it does not allow us to conclude &lt;strong&gt;which&lt;/strong&gt; are different from each other. For this purpose, there are post-hoc tests that compare all groups two by two to determine which ones are different, after adjusting for multiple comparisons. Concretely, post-hoc tests are performed to each possible pair of groups &lt;strong&gt;after&lt;/strong&gt; an ANOVA or a Kruskal-Wallis test has shown that there is at least one group which is different (hence “post” in the name of this type of test). The null and alternative hypotheses and the interpretations of these tests are similar to a Student’s t-test for two samples.&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-back&#34;&gt;↩︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#additional-note&#34;&gt;Additional note&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id=&#34;introduction&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this article, I show how to create a timeline of your CV in R. A CV timeline illustrates key information about your education, work experiences and extra activities. The main advantage of CV timelines compared to regular CV is that they make you stand out immediately by being visually appealing and easier to scan. It also allows you to better present your “story” by showing the chronology of your jobs and activities and thus explain how you got to where you are today. (It can also be part of your portfolio to show your R skills.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We show below how to create such CV in R with a minimal reproducible example. Feel free to use the code and adapt it to you. For a more complete example (together with the code) you can check my own &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.antoinesoetewey.com/files/CV_timeline_antoinesoetewey.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;CV timeline&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that I wrote this article after reading this &lt;a href=&#34;https://datascienceplus.com/visualize-your-cvs-timeline-with-r-gantt-style/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;original post&lt;/a&gt; by Bernardo Lares, and in particular his package, i.e., &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/laresbernardo/lares&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;{lares}&lt;/code&gt; package&lt;/a&gt;. A special thanks for his amazing work which was used to create a slightly modified version of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/laresbernardo/lares/blob/master/R/other_plots.R#L19&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;plot_timeline()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; function!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;minimal-reproducible-example&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Minimal reproducible example&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the code and the result of a minimal reproducible example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;script src=&#34;https://gist.github.com/AntoineSoetewey/c6e83ad501a4b8c12b32cf9d5c06e9f9.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/blog/how-to-construct-a-timeline-of-your-cv-in-r_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png&#34; width=&#34;100%&#34; style=&#34;display: block; margin: auto;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;how-to-personalize-it&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;How to personalize it&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to edit the example with your own academic, extra and work experiences you basically just have to edit the dataframe called &lt;code&gt;cv&lt;/code&gt; in the code above. Each row of the dataset &lt;code&gt;cv&lt;/code&gt; is a different academic program, job or activity. Rows should include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the name of the academic program, job title or activity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the name of the university, school, company or workplace&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the category: academic, work experience or extra&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the starting date (dates must be in format &lt;code&gt;yyyy-mm-dd&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the ending date. If the role has not yet ended, type &lt;code&gt;today&lt;/code&gt; instead of the date. By using &lt;code&gt;today&lt;/code&gt; your CV timeline will automatically adapt to today’s date&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add or remove a row in the dataframe if you want to add or remove a role. Indicate &lt;code&gt;NA&lt;/code&gt; if you do not want to specify any workplace (as it has been done for &lt;code&gt;Extra3&lt;/code&gt;). Last, do not forget to replace my name with yours for the subtitle of the timeline at the end of the code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Experienced R users may wish to edit the &lt;code&gt;plot_timeline2&lt;/code&gt; function to their needs. However, if you are happy with the template and design of the example, you only have to change things mentioned above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;additional-note&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Additional note&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of editing the code according to your roles directly in the script, you can also create an Excel file with the required data (job title, workplace, type, start date, end date) and then &lt;a href=&#34;/blog/how-to-import-an-excel-file-in-rstudio/&#34;&gt;import it into R&lt;/a&gt;. Editing the Excel file is easier and less prone to coding errors. Moreover, if you have a long career, the code may become long while if you import the Excel file, it will always stay short and concise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading. I hope this article helped you to create a timeline of your CV in R. If you would like to see a more complete and live example, see &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.antoinesoetewey.com/files/CV_timeline_antoinesoetewey.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;my timeline CV&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As always, if you have a question or a suggestion related to the topic covered in this article, please add it as a comment so other readers can benefit from the discussion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A special thanks to Prof. Job N Nmadu for the suggestion about creating the file that holds the data.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
