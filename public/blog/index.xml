Introduction Remember that descriptive statistics is a branch of statistics aiming at describing and summarizing a set of data in the best possible manner, that is, by reducing them down to a few meaningful key measures and visualizations (with as little loss of information as possible). In other words, descriptive statistics helps to have a better understanding and a clear image about a set of observations thanks to summary statistics and graphics.</description>

In other words, this test is used to determine whether the values of one of the 2 qualitative variables depend on the values of the other qualitative variable.</description>

 People often fail to properly distinguish between population and sample. It is however essential in any statistical analysis, starting from descriptive statistics with different formulas for variance and standard deviation depending on whether we face a sample or a population. Moreover, the branch of statistics called inferential statistics is often defined as the science of drawing conclusions about a population from observations made on a representative sample of that population.</description>

 Statistics is divided into four main branches:
 Descriptive statistics Inferential statistics Predictive analysis Exploratory analysis  Descriptive statistics provide a summary of the data; it helps explaining the data in a concise way without losing too much information. Data can be summarized numerically or graphically. See descriptive statistics by hand or in R to learn more about this branch of statistics.</description>

create a new post as usual add runtime: shiny (and output: html_document if it is not already included) in the YAML metadata insert the following HTML code in the body of the post:  &amp;lt;iframe height=&amp;quot;800&amp;quot; width=&amp;quot;100%&amp;quot; frameborder=&amp;quot;no&amp;quot; src=&amp;quot;https://antoinesoetewey.shinyapps.io/statistics-201/&amp;quot;&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/iframe&amp;gt; You should change the URL with the URL of your deployed Shiny app (after src=, do not forget that the URL should start with http:// or https:// and should be surrounded by &amp;quot;).</description>

 This is the first post for the blog Stats and R, just to introduce it. This blog aims at helping academics and professionals working with data to grasp important concepts in statistics and to apply them in R.
The goal of this website is to make statistics easy to understand by illustrating with examples and using plain English. When possible, for all statistical concepts covered here, I also write an article on how to apply these concepts in R.</description>
