      <description>Introduction Empirical rule Parameters Characteristics Probabilities and quantiles Examples in R and by hand  References   Introduction Many natural phenomena in real life can be approximated by a bell-shaped frequency distribution known as a normal distribution or the Gaussian distribution.
 Empirical rule Data possessing an approximately normal distribution have a definite variation, as expressed by the following empirical rule:
 \(\mu \pm \sigma\) includes approximately 68% of the observations \(\mu \pm 2 \cdot \sigma\) includes approximately 95% of the observations \(\mu \pm 3 \cdot \sigma\) includes almost all of the observations (99.</description>

      <description>Introduction Hypotheses Example Data Observed frequencies Expected frequencies Fisher’s exact test in R Conclusion and interpretation  References   Introduction After presenting the Chi-square test of independence by hand and in R, this article focuses on the Fisher’s exact test.
Independence tests are used to determine if there is a significant relationship between two categorical variables. There exists two different types of independence test:
 the Chi-square test (the most common) the Fisher’s exact test  On the one hand, the Chi-square test is used when the sample is large enough (in this case the \(p\)-value is an approximation that becomes exact when the sample becomes infinite, which is the case for many statistical tests).</description>

      <description>Introduction Hypotheses How the test works? Example Observed frequencies Expected frequencies Test statistic Critical value Conclusion and interpretation    Introduction Chi-square tests of independence test whether two qualitative variables are independent, that is, whether there exists a relationship between two categorical variables. In other words, this test is used to determine whether the values of one of the 2 qualitative variables depend on the values of the other qualitative variable.</description>

      <description>Introduction Minimal reproducible example How to personalize it Additional note   Introduction In this article, I show how to create a timeline of your CV in R. A CV timeline illustrates key information about your education, work experiences and extra activities. The main advantage of CV timelines compared to regular CV is that they make you stand out immediately by being visually appealing and easier to scan. It also allows you to better present your “story” by showing the chronology of your jobs and activities and thus explain how you got to where you are today.</description>

      <guid>/blog/what-is-the-difference-between-population-and-sample/</guid>
      <description>People often fail to properly distinguish between population and sample. It is however essential in any statistical anlysis, starting from descriptive statistics with different formulas for variance and standard deviation depending on whether we face a sample or a population. Moreover, the branch of statistics called inferential statistics is often defined as the science of drawing conclusions about a population from observations made on a representative sample of that population.</description>

      <description>Statistics is divided into four main branches:
 Descriptive statistics Inferential statistics Predictive analysis Exploratory analysis  Descriptive statistics provide a summary of the data; it helps explaining the data in a concise way without losing too much information. Data can be summarized numerically or graphically. See descriptive statistics by hand or in R to learn more about this branch of statistics.
The branch of predictive analysis aims at predicting a dependent variable based on one or several independent variables.</description>

      <description>Simple linear regression is a statistical method to summarize and study relationships between two variables. When more than two variables are of interest, it is referred as multiple linear regression.
In this article, we focus only on a Shiny app which allows to perform simple linear regression by hand and in R:

      <description>In his book A Random Walk down Wall Street, Burton G. Malkiel advises readers of an optimal asset allocation depending on age. As an amateur investor, I thought it would be useful to develop a Shiny app which depicts his advices for other interested investors. Here is the link to the app:

      <description>This is the first post for the blog Stats and R, just to introduce it. This blog aims at helping academics and professionals working with data to grasp important concepts in statistics and to apply them in R.
The goal of this website is to make statistics easy to understand by illustrating with examples and using plain English. When possible, for all statistical concepts covered here, I also write an article on how to apply these concepts in R.</description>
