Welcome to the blog [Stats and R](https://www.statsandr.com/). As the name suggests, this blog is about [statistics](https://www.statsandr.com/tags/statistics/) and its applications in [R](https://www.statsandr.com/tags/r/) (an open source statistical software program). It aims at helping academics and professionals working with data to grasp important concepts in statistics and to apply them in R.

The goal of this website is to make statistics easy to understand by illustrating statistical notions with examples and using plain English. When possible, for all statistical concepts covered in this blog, there is also an article on how to apply them in R.
